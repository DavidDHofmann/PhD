\newlabel{MovementModel}{{4}{32}{(a) Most parsimonious movement model for dispersing wild dogs. The model includes a habitat kernel, a movement kernel, as well as their interactions. The horizontal line segments delineate the 90\%, 95\%, and 99\% Confidence-Intervals for the respective \(\beta \)-coefficients. Significance codes: * \(p < 0.10\), ** \(p < 0.05\), *** \(p < 0.01\). (b) Results from the k-fold cross validation procedure. The upper plot shows rank frequencies of realized steps according to model predictions with known preferences, whereas the lower plot shows rank frequencies of realized steps when assuming random preferences. The blue ribbon shows the prediction interval around a loess smoothing regression that we fitted to ease the interpretation of the plots. The significant correlation between rank and associated frequency in (b1) highlights that the most parsimonious model successfully outperforms a random guess (b2) and assigns comparably high selection scores to realized steps.\relax }{figure.caption.6}{}}
