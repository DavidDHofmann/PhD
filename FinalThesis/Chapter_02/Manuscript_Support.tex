\section{Dispersal Model}
\label{DispersalModel}
The model employed to simulate dispersal was based on an integrated step
selection function (iSSF). In (integrated) step selection functions (iSSFs,
\citealp{Fortin.2005, Avgar.2016}), observed GPS locations are converted into
steps (the straight-line traveled between two GPS recordings
\citep{Turchin.1998}) and compared to a set of \textit{random} steps in a
conditional logistic regression framework \citep{Fortin.2005, Thurfjell.2014,
Muff.2020, Fieberg.2021}. The model presented in \citep{Hofmann.2023} used
dispersal data collected on 16 dispersing AWDs from a free-ranging wild dog
population in northern Botswana. GPS data during dispersal was collected at
4-hourly intervals and translated into steps of similar duration. Observed steps
were then paired step with 24 random steps that were generated using a uniform
distribution for turning angles (\(-\pi, +\pi\)) and step lengths from a gamma
distribution fitted to observed steps (scale \(\theta\) = 6,308 and shape \(k\)
= 0.37). It was then assumed that animals assigned to each observed and random
step a selection score of the form \citep{Fortin.2005}:

\begin{equation}
  w(x) = exp(\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n)
\end{equation}

Where (\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)) represent the covariate values along each of the
steps and the (\(\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n\)) are the animal's relative
selection strengths \citep{Avgar.2017} towards these covariates. The benefit
of \textit{integrated} SSFs over regular SSFs is that they provide a means to
render two complementary ``kernels''. A \textit{movement} kernel that describes
general movement behavior of dispersing AWDs and a \textit{habitat} kernel that
describes preferences of AWDs with regards to environmental conditions
\citep{Fieberg.2021}. iSSFs also allow interactions among the two kernels and
are thus suitable to render that movement behavior may change depending on
habitat conditions. A fitted iSSF model can be used as an individual-based
movement model to simulate dispersal \citep{Signer.2017, Hofmann.2023}.

\section{Alternative Approach to Map Potential Human-Wildlife Interactions}
\label{AlternativeHWC}

To identify potential hotspots for human-wildlife conflict and generate
\Cref{Metrics}c, we isolated all simulated animal locations within 500 meters to
a human-influenced grid-cell (\Cref{Metrics}c in the main manuscript). To
compute the needed distances, we assumed human-influence to be binary (influence
= 1, no influence = 0), thus ignoring potential impacts of human density. We
argue that the severity of human-wildlife conflict is not necessarily related to
human density, yet humans' attitude towards wildlife. Attitude often correlates
negatively with habitat suitability for the species of interest
\citep{Behr.2017}, and so conflict is often pronounced in peripheral areas
\citep{McNutt.2017}. Since we lacked detailed information of anthropogenic
resistance \citep{Ghoddousi.2021} across the study area, we deemed a binary
representation of human impacts as appropriate. Alternatively, one can also
compute a compound score by multiplying the human-influence layer with the
heatmaps derived from simulated dispersal. This is presented in
\Cref{HWCAlternative}, where we multiplied the heatmaps (\Cref{HWCAlternative}a)
with the human-influence layer (\Cref{HWCAlternative}b) and produced maps
showing potential for human-wildlife conflict. Qualitatively, the maps in
\Cref{HWCAlternative} are very similar to the ones presented in Figure 5c.

  approach to quantifying the potential for human-wildlife conflict. Here, we
  multiplied the heatmaps (a) with the human-influence layer (b) to obtain
  human-wildlife conflict maps (c1). We also computed a difference map (c2) for
  the layers shown in c1.}
