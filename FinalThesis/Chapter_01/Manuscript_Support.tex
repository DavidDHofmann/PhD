\section{Candidate Interactions}
\label{CandidateInteractions}

We started with the base model developed by \citet{Hofmann.2021} and
incrementally increased model complexity by adding all possible two-way
interactions between habitat covariates and movement covariates. For instance,
for the covariate \textsf{Water}, we proposed the interactions
\textsf{Water:sl}, \textsf{Water:log(sl)}, and \textsf{Water:cos(ta)}. Besides
these interactions, we also allowed for correlations between turning angles and
step lengths by proposing the interactions \textsf{sl:cos(ta)} and
\textsf{log(sl):cos(ta)}. Furthermore, we formed the interactions
\textsf{sl:LowActivity} and \textsf{log(sl):LowActivity} to render that step
lengths are likely to be shorter during periods of inactivity.

\section{K-Fold Cross Validation Procedure}
\label{CrossValidation}

We validated the predictive power of the most parsimonious movement model using
k-fold cross-validation for case-control studies \citep{Fortin.2009}.
Specifically, we randomly assigned 80\% of the strata to a training set and the
remaining 20\% to a testing set. Using the training set, we parametrized a
movement model and predicted selection scores \(w(x)\) for all steps in the
testing set. Within each stratum, we then assigned ranks 1-25 to each step based
on predicted selection scores, so that rank 1 was given to the step with the
highest score \(w(x)\). Within each strata, we determined the realized step's
rank and calculated rank frequencies of realized steps across all strata.
Finally, we computed Spearman's rank correlation between ranks and associated
frequencies \(r_{s, realized}\). We replicated this procedure 100 times and
computed the mean correlation coefficient (\(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\)), as well
as its 95\% confidence interval across all replicates. For comparison, we
repeated the same procedure 100 times assuming random preferences. Random
preferences were implemented by discarding the realized step from all strata and
identifying the rank of a random step in each stratum. Again, we calculated
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\(r_{s, random}\)), its mean across
repetitions (\(\bar{r}_{s, random}\)), and its 95\% confidence interval.
Ultimately, this validation proves a significant prediction in case the
confidence intervals of \(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\) and \(\bar{r}_{s, random}\) do
not overlap \citep{Fortin.2009}.

  considered contiguous protected areas (national parks, game reserves, and
  forest reserves) that were larger than 700 km\textsuperscript{2}. This size
  corresponds to the average home range requirement for viable wild dog
  populations \citep{Pomilia.2015}. To render potential immigrants into the
  study system, we also initiated dispersers within a buffer zone (blue)
  surrounding the main study area. (b) Source points from which dispersers were

%	Appendix S4: Betweenness Approaches
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\section{Betweenness Maps}
\label{BetweennessApproaches}

To generate betweenness maps, we first overlaid the study area with a regular
grid with a resolution of 2.5 km x 2.5 km per grid cell. The grid cells were
labeled with unique numbers, which allowed us to then generate a ``visitation
history'' for each simulated trajectory, showing through which grid cells each
simulated individual moved. Based on this history, we tallied the number of
transitions that occurred from one cell to another. Ultimately, the so generated
list of transitions served to generate a network and to compute betweenness
scores. The resolution of the overlaid grid thus dictates the resolution at
which betweenness can be mapped and has important implications for the way in
which cell-transitions need to be determined. In the simplest case,
cell-transitions can be determined by only looking at the start and endpoint of
each step. If it ends in a different grid-cell than it started, a transition has
occurred. This approach is computationally simple as it only requires a point
extraction (at the start and endpoint of each step). However, relying on a point
extraction has the disadvantage that transitions between non-adjacent cells can
occur if a single step stretches across multiple grid-cells. Especially when the
resolution of the grid is high, this problem becomes more pertinent. As an
alternative, one could not only consider the start and endpoint of each step,
but the entire line along the step, i.e. conduct a line extraction. However,
this requires that extracted values (i.e. grid-cell labels) are ordered in
accordance to the direction of movement. In R, such an extraction can be
achieved e.g. using \texttt{raster::extract(raster, line, along = T)}, which is
computationally very demanding and therefore often an nonviable solution. Here,
we employed yet another approach and generated interpolated coordinates along
each simulated step. We then determined cell transition using those interpolated
coordinates. Since this approach still uses a point extraction, it is
considerably faster while still enabling to detect cell-transitions at greater
resolution. In \Cref{BetweennessApproaches}, we use simulated movement paths to
compare betweenness maps that are based on a (1) point extraction, a (2) line
extraction, and a (3) point extraction with interpolated coordinates. As you can
see, the approach using interpolated coordinates approximates the results from
the line extraction very closely, even at higher resolutions. A detailed
discussion about this is can also be found in \citep{Bastille-Rousseau.2018}.

  \caption{We simulated five trajectories where individuals moved through a
  narrow corridor. We then overlaid those simulations with a coarse (a1) and
  detailed (b1) grid that was used to compute betweenness scores. This required
  us to determine cell-transitions, which we did using three competing
  approaches. Once using a point extraction (a2 and b2), once using a line
  extraction (a3 and b3), and once using a point extraction with interpolated
  coordinates (a4 and b4). In brackets are the average computation times $\pm$

\newpage
\section{Movement Model Interpretation}
\label{ModelInterpretation}

To ease with the interpretation of the most parsimonious movement model, we
followed recommendations published in \citet{Fieberg.2021} and produced a series
of plots highlighting how the habitat and movement kernel depended on covariate
values (\Cref{Interpretation}). To visualize the movement kernel and its
interactions with other covariates, we used model estimates and updated our
tentative distribution parameters for turning angles (von Mises distribution
with concentration \(\kappa = 0\)) and step lengths (gamma distribution with
scale \(\theta\) = 6'308 and shape \(k\) = 0.37) by applying the function
\texttt{update\_vonmises()} from the \texttt{R}-package \texttt{amt}
\citep{Signer.2019}. This allowed us to compute probability densities of turning
angles and step lengths under varying values of the associated covariates, while
holding all other covariates constant (\Cref{Interpretation}, a1-a8). Moreover,
we investigated the habitat kernel by computing relative selection strengths
(RSS) between a set of steps where values of the covariate of interest was
varied to a reference step where the covariate value was fixed to its centered
value. To illustrate model uncertainty, we also generated large-sample
confidence intervals using standard errors associated with each model estimate
(\Cref{Interpretation}, b1-b5).

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{Figures/MovementModelInterpretation.png}
  \caption{Auxiliary plots that help with the interpretation of the most
  parsimonious movement model. The plots were generated following
  recommendations reported in \citet{Fieberg.2021}. Subplots a1 to a8 highlight
  dispersing wild dogs' movement kernel and indicate how the kernel is
  influenced by interactions with other covariates. Subplots b1 to b5 depict
  results from dispersing wild dogs' habitat kernel and highlight differences in
  predicted relative selection scores (RSS) when varying values of the covariate
  of interest. For each covariate, predictions were made on the range of values
  that was observed in the real data, assuming that all other covariates were
  centered and that steps were realized during periods of ``high'' wild dog
  activity. Plot a1, for example, can be interpreted as follows: the probability
  of realizing a step with a low turning angle is much higher when the
  corresponding step is large. Moreover, b1 can be interpreted as follows:
  relative probability of using a step decreases as the amount of water cover
  along the step increases.}
