\newlabel{GraphicalAbstract}{{1}{32}{Flowchart of the simulation-based connectivity analysis as proposed in this article. First, GPS data and habitat covariates have to be collected. The combined data is then analyzed in an integrated step selection model, which enables the parametrization of the focal species' habitat and movement kernels. The parametrized model is then treated as an individual-based movement model and used to simulate dispersal trajectories. Ultimately, simulated trajectories serve to produce a set of maps that are pertinent to landscape connectivity. This includes a heatmap, indicating the relative traversal frequency across the study area, a betweenness map, highlighting movement corridors and bottlenecks, and, finally, an inter-patch connectivity map, where the frequency of connections and their average duration can be depicted. \textcolor {red}{Photos: Whom to cite?

(1) Number of simulated trajectories. (2) Handling individual variation: we used point estimates when simulating dispersers, assuming that there was no individual variation.

While one could draw the number of simulated steps based on observed dispersal events, we opted for an alternative and simulated each individual for 2'000 steps, which was at the upper end of observed dispersal durations. This allows to easily shorten the generated trajectories afterwards and to investigate the sensitivity of results with regards to the dispersal duration. (4) Boundary behavior. We allowed dispersers to leave and re-enter the main study area through a buffer zone with randomized covariate values. Alternatively, one could discard transgressing random steps, thereby forcing dispersers to remain within the study area or simply terminate the simulation, assuming the individual has disappeared.

For our simulation, we placed source points within protected areas large enough to sustain viable wild dog populations.
