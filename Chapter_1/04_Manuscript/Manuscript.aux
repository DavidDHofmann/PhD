Betweenness scores were determined based on simulated dispersal events. A high betweenness score highlights cells that are exceptionally relevant in connecting different regions in the study area. That is, the higher the betweenness score, the more often a pixel lies on a shortest path between adjacent areas. In this sense the metric can be used to pinpoint discrete movement corridors.
