\begin{abstract}
For many species, a sufficient degree of landscape connectivity is a crucial
prerequisite for long-term species persistence. This is especially true for
animals that exhibit long-distance dispersal, as dispersers typically cross a
variety of habitats and potentially move into unfamiliar territory. Estimating
habitat permeability and quantifying landscape connectivity have therefore
become two major tasks in conservation ecology. For this, least-cost analysis
and circuit theory have been the two workhorses during the past two decades.
This is largely owed to their ease of use and intuitive nature which has
facilitated the application of the methods across a broad range of the animal
kingdom. However, both methods make several restricting assumptions that limit
their usefulness in reality.

Recent innovations in movement ecology, particularly on step selection analysis,
have brought forward novel ways to look at connectivity. For instance,
integrated step selection functions provide a means to parametrize a fully
mechanistic movement model based on which virtual dispersers could be simulated.
While this approach has been used to infer habitat utilization, it may also
serve to highlight landscape connectivity and pinpoint dispersal corridors.

Here, we propose the simulation of dispersal trajectories as a much more generic
way to identify dispersal barriers and potential movement corridors. To achieve
this, we applied integrated step selection analysis and uses data from 16
dispersing wild dogs to parametrize a fully mechanistic movement model for
dispersing African wild dogs. The model rendered dispersers' habitat and
movement preferences, as well as potential interactions between them. Based on
the model, we simulated myriads of dispersal trajectories and inferred dispersal
corridors across the earth's largest transboundary conservation area, the
Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. We also exemplify how such
simulations could be analysed using network theory. Finally, we discuss the
benefits and pitfalls of dispersal simualtions and highlight potential
improvements to be made in the future.

\section{Introduction}
% Importance of Dispersal & Connectivity
Dispersal of individuals is an important process governing the dynamics wild
animal populations that are distributed in space \citep{Clobert.2012}. It is
defined as the movement of individuals from their natal location to the site of
first reproduction \cite{Howard.1960} and allows species to avoid inbreeding
\citep{Perrin.1999, Perrin.2000, Frankham.2002, Leigh.2012}, to rescue small and
unviable populations \citep{Brown.1977}, and to promote the colonization of
unoccupied habitats \citep{Hanski.1998, MacArthur.2001}. Successfull dispersal
requires a sufficient degree of landscape connectivity, which is why the
protection of dispersal corridors has become a major goal in conservation
science. Information on movement behavior during dispersal and knowledge about
the factors that limit dispersal is therefore critical for a comprehensive
understanding of landscape connectivity and population viability
\citep{Baguette.2013, Vasudev.2015}. In addition, reliable modelling techniques
to identify dispersal corridors based on empirical data are necessary
\citep{Diniz.2019}.

% Advancements in GPS Technology and Movement Ecology
Thanks to novel technologies developed over the past decades, particularly of
GPS/Satellite radio-collars, the study of dispersal and connectivity using
telemetry data has accelerated \citep{Jonsson.2016, Williams.2019}.
Additionally, the advent of publicly accessible satellite imagery and
sophisticated remote sensing techniques to represent the physical landscape
through which individuals disperse have heralded the ``golden age of animal
tracking'' \citep{Kays.2015}. Concurrently, the increased availability of large
amounts of empirical data and an increased computational power have led to the
development of several modelling techniques that allow studying movement
behavior during dispersal and highlighting major movement corridors
\citep{Boyce.2002, Fortin.2005, Cushman.2010, Zeller.2012, Diniz.2019}.

% Resource Selection & Connectivity
\textit{Resource selection functions} \citep{Boyce.2002} and derived methods
such as \textit{step selection functions} \citep{Fortin.2005} and \textit{path
selection functions} \citep{Cushman.2010} have proven particularly useful for
studying animal movement \citep{Fieberg.2020}. These methods allow estimating
habitat preferences of the focal species by comparing covariates at locations
visited by the animal to the scame covariates at locations available to, but not
visited by the animal. The so estimated preferences can then be used to predict
a permeability surface, indicating the expected ease at which an animal can
traverse a given area \citep{Zeller.2012}. Utimately, the permeability surface
serves as input to a connectivity model that is used to reveal movement
corridors. In this regard, two of the most prominent connectivity models in the
literature are least-cost path analysis \citep{Adriaensen.2003} and circuit
theory \citep{McRae.2006, McRae.2008}.

% Least-cost path
In least-cost path analysis, connectivity is estimated by identifying
least-costly routes between pre-defined start- and endpoints
\citep{Adriaensen.2003}. For this, the permeability surface is converted into a
network graph and permeability scores are translated into probabilities for
moving from one cell to another. Least-costly routes between start- and
endpoints can then be computed using Dijkstra’s algorithm \citep{Dijkstra.1959}.
Although intuitively appealing, the method suffers from several weaknesses.
First of all, a least-cost path always exist, even if the associated costs are
unreasonably high. Second, it assumes that animals have a preconceived end-point
in mind and choose a cost-minimizing route accordingly. While this assumption
may be reasonable for migrating animals that move between a limited number of
habitats, it is unlikely to hold for dispersers that move over long distances
into unknown territory \citep{Koen.2014, Abrahms.2017, Cozzi.2020}. Finally, the
method also requires that animals have an infinite perceptual range, otherwise
they could not compute an optimal path. Some of these issues have been addressed
using alternative least-cost approaches. For instance, instead of computing a
least-cost path, a least cost-corridor that also considers slightly suboptimal
routes \citep{Pinto.2009} can be calculated. The corridor relaxes the assumption
of perfect knowledge and overcomes the single pixel width issue. Alternatively,
the randomized least-cost path has been proposed, which allows animals to
deviate from the least-cost route by a pre-defined factor \(\theta\)
\citep{Panzacchi.2016, VanMoorter.2021}.

% Circuit theory
In contrast to least-cost approaches, circuit theory makes use of electrical
circuit theory to quantify landscape connectivity \citep{McRae.2006,
McRae.2008}. Here, the permeability surface is converted into an electrical
circuit containing nodes and resistor, where resistance values depend on habitat
permeability. A source point is connected to a current source, whereas an
endpoint is grounded. Hence, the current flowing through each node in the
circuit can be computed and is supposed to resemble the relative frequency at
which each location in the study area is being visited. By revealing not only a
single path or corridor, circuit theory overcomes the single-pixel width issue
inherent to least-cost approaches. Intrinsically, circuit theory is based on the
assumption that animals follow a random walk and can therefore not render
directional biases. In reality, however, dispersers often move in a very
directional fashion as they want to cover as much ground in as little time as
possible. Furthermore, it is assumed that individuals have a perceptual range of
a single pixel, which rarely captures the true spatial scale of selection (cite
someone).

% Temporal scale
Neither least-cost analyes or circuit theory are capable of rendering the
temporal dimension of movement. Such influences could, however, be studied using
individual based movement models. Still, only few have explored these
possibilities \citep{Kanangaraj.2013, Hauenstein.2019, Zeller.2020}.

% Step selection analysis
While step selection functions were initially intended to learn about habitat
preferences of the focal species \citep{Fortin.2005}, recent improvements may
elevate its applicability into other areas. Originally, \cite{Fortin.2005}
proposed step selection functions to account for serial autocorrelation inherent
to GPS relocation data. In this method, covariates along realized steps (the
connecting lines between two consecutive relocations; ; \citealp{Turchin.1998})
are contrasted to covariates along  ``alternative''  or  ``random steps'' that
are generated by randomly sampling turning angles and step lengths based on
observed movement characteristics. It is then assumed that animals assign a
selection score \(w(x)\) of the following form to each step:

\begin{equation}
\label{EQ1}
  w(x) = exp(\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n)
\end{equation}

The selection score \(w(x)\) of each step depends on its associated covariates
(\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)) and on the animal's relative selection strengths (i.e.
preferences) towards these covariates (\(\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n\)). The
probability that a step \(i\) is realized \(P(Y_{i} = 1\)) then depends on the
step's selection score, as well as on the selection scores of all alternative
steps:

\begin{equation}
\label{EQ2}
  P(Y_{i} = 1 | Y_{1} + Y_{2} + ... + Y_{i} = 1) =
  \frac{w(x_{i})}{w(x_{1}) + w(x_{2}) + ... + w(x_{i})}
\end{equation}

\noindent Preferences of interest, i.e. the \(\beta\)'s, can be estimated by
comparing realized (scored 1) and random (scored 0) steps in a conditional
logistic regression model \citep{Fortin.2005}. In this model, positive
\(\beta\)-coefficients indicate selection of a covariate, whereas negative
\(\beta\)-coefficients indicate avoidance of a covariate. To deal with multiple
individuals, one can either average estimates of individual models
\citep{Murtaugh.2007, Fieberg.2010} or apply mixed effects conditional logistic
regression analysis as recently proposed by \cite{Muff.2020}.

% Integrated step selection analysis
An animals movement trajectory can be seen as the result of an interplay between
habitat and movement preferences. Traditional step selection functions cannot
account for a correlation between turning angles and step lengths, unless the
two are sampled jointly from a copula distribution \citep{Hodel.2021}. Recently,
however, SSFs have been generalized to \textit{integrated} SSFs (iSSFs), which
tear apart movement and habitat preferences of the studied animals
\citep{Avgar.2016}. The method thus allows to render an animals preferences with
respect to prevailing habitat conditions, as well as with respect to movement
characteristics. This reduces potential biases in estimated preferences and
enables parametrization of a fully mechanistic movement model from which
movement and space use can be simulated \citep{Avgar.2016, Signer.2017}.
\cite{Signer.2017} used integrated step selection analysis to simulate steady
state utilization distributions of resident animals. However, the degree to
which such simulations could be used to simulate dispersers and infer movement
corridors is unknown.

% Study Species & Study Area
One of the species for which long-term species persistence relies on sufficient
landscape connectivity is the endangered African wild dog \textit{Lycon pictus}.
This species has once been wide-spread across sub-Saharan Africa but disappeared
from a vast majority of its historic range due to ongoing persecution by humans,
habitat destruction, and deadly diseases. As of today, only 6'000 free-ranging
individuals remain in small and spatially scattered subpopulations. Within those
subpopulations, wild dogs form cohesive packs comprising 8 to 12 adults and
their offspring \cite{McNutt.1995}. After reaching sexual maturity, male and
female offspring form same-sex coalitions and disperse from their natal pack
\citep{McNutt.1996, Behr.2020}. New packs are formed when dispersing coalitions
join unrelated opposite-sex dispersing coalitions \citep{McNutt.1996}.
Dispersing wild dogs can cover several hundred kilometers across a variety of
landscapes \citep{DaviesMostert.2012, Masenga.2016, Cozzi.2020, Hofmann.2021}.
One of the few strongholds for this species lies near the Moremi Game Reserve in
northern Botswana, which is part of the world's largest transboundary protected
area, namely the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA-TFCA).
This area has originally been intended to facilitate migration of elephants, but
is expected to benefit a multitude of other species \citep{Elliot.2014,
Brennan.2020, Hofmann.2021}.

In a previous paper, we assessed landscape connectivity within the KAZA-TFCA for
dispersing African wild dogs using a least-cost corridor approach. For this, we
fitted a basic habitat selection model based on which we predicted landscape
permeability. We now expand on this knowledge and develop a more detailed
movement model of dispersing wild dogs. We then use this model to simulate
thousands of dispersers moving throughout the KAZA. Based on said simulations,
we compute heatmaps and identify potential dispersal hotspots and compare them
to the dispersal routes identified in \citep{Hofmann.2021}. We also showcase how
simulated dispersal data can be analysed using network-analysis and how network
metrics relevant to landscape connectivity can be computed. Our results suggest
that a simulation based approach yields several major benefits over traditional
connectivity modelling techniques. Most importantly, simulations provide a more
generic view on how connectivity emerges and to which degree connectivity
depends on the dispersal duration. In addtion, by generating proper dispersal
trajectories, network theory can be applied to calculate network metrics that
are pertinent to connectivity analysis. Finally, we put forward additional
opportunities using simulations that go beyond the scope of this paper.


Reliable identification of dispersal corridors will become increasingly
important with the uprise of ever-growing and often transboundary conservation
areas. One such instance is the KAZA-TFCA, a massive conservation area spanning
five countries and over 520'000 km\textsuperscript{2}. The KAZA holds the
potential of re-establishing dispersal routes for many of its protected species,
including the african wild dog \textit{Lycaon pictus}.  Persecution by humans,
habitat loss, and reduced connectivity are major causes of the decline of the
species \citep{Woodroffe.2012}. In result, the species currently marks the
KAZA's most endangered large carnivore and has been a assigned a very high
conservation priority. Importantly, due to their inherent mobility and intrinsic
need for vast undisturbed landscapes, AWDs have been proposed as surrogate
species for landscape connectivity (see recent paper on multispecies
connectivity). Nevertheless, the species has received little attention in the
connectivity literature, mainly due to the difficulty in observing wild dog
dispersal.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Study Area}
The study area (centered at -17\degree 13'9''S, 23\degree 56'4''E;
\Cref{StudyArea}a) stretched over 1.3 Mio km\textsuperscript{2} and ecompassed
the entire KAZA-TFCA (\Cref{StudyArea}b). The KAZA-TFCA is the world's largest
transboundary conservation area and comprises parts of Angola, Botswana,
Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, covering a total area of over 520'000
km\textsuperscript{2}. Its landscape varies regionally and ranges from savanna,
to grassland, and from dry to moist woodland habitats. A dominant
hydrogeographical feature in its center is the Okavango Delta, the earth's
largest inland delta. The delta and its surroundings are considered a stronghold
for African wild dogs and may act as a source for the recolonization of
surrounding habitats. The wet season within our study area lasts from November
to March and is out of phase with the main flooding of the Okavango Delta which
peaks between July and August \citep{McNutt.1996, Wolski.2017}.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{GPS Relocation Data}
Between 2011 and 2020, we collected GPS relocation data on dispersing wild dogs
from a free-ranging wild dog population inhabiting the Okavango Delta in
northern Botswana. We identified potential dispersers based on age, number of
same‐sex siblings, pack size, and presence of unrelated opposite-sex individuals
in the pack \citep{McNutt.1996, Behr.2020}. We immobilized individuals using a
cocktail of Ketamine/Xylazine/Atropine \citep{Osofsky.1996, Cozzi.2020},
injected with a dart that was fired from a CO\textsubscript{2}-pressurized gun
(\textit{DAN-Inject, Denmark}). Protocols for the anesthization protocols were
approved by the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and
Tourism of Botswana (permit EWT 8/36/4 XXXVI). After immobilization, individuals
were fitted with GPS/Satellite radio collars (\textit{Vertex Lite; Vectronic
Aerospace GmbH, Berlin}) that included an automated drop-off mechanism. Handling
and collaring of all individuals was carried out and supervised by a
Botswana-registered wildlife veterinarian. All of the immobilized individuals
quickly rejoined their pack within one hour after the procedure. Out of all
collared individuals, 16 eventually dispersed in separate same-sex coalitions
and their trajectories were successfully recorded (7 female and 9 male
coalitions).

During dispersal, collars were programmed to record a GPS fix every 4 hours.
Recorded relocations were regularly transmitted over the Iridium satellite
system, which allowed remote tracking of individuals, even if they left the main
study area and crossed international borders. To effectively distinguish between
periods of residency and dispersal, we applied the net-squared displacement
metric to the observed movement data. This metric measures the squared Euclidean
distance of a collared individual to a reference point \citep{Borger.2012},
which we set at the center of each disperser's natal home range. Hence,
dispersal was deemed to have started when an individual left its natal home
range and ended when the individual became stationary again. For the purpose of
this study, we discarded andy data that was collected during residency. Because
previous research could not find any differences between males and females
during dispersal \citep{Woodroffe.2019, Cozzi.2020}, we did not distinguish
sexes for the sake of our analyses. Ultimately, we converted the collected GPS
relocations to steps, where each step represented the straight-line distance
travelled between two consequtive GPS relocations \citep{Turchin.1998}.

\subsection{Covariates}
To represent habitat covariates, we prepared a set of spatial raster layers
depicting water-cover (dynamically updated), distance to water (dynamically
updated), tree-cover, and shrub/grassland-cover. To render a decreasing impact
with increasing distance, we square rooted the distance to water covariate
layer. We also created a proxy for human influence, rendering anthropogenic
pressures stemming from human-density, agricultural sites, and roads. We
rendered all layers at a resolution of 250m by 250m for the entire extent of the
KAZA-TFCA. Further details on the derivation and preparation of each
environmental covariate is given in \cite{Hofmann.2020}.

Besides habitat covariates, we also computed movement metrics that we used as
movement covariates in our models. These covariates included the step length
(\(sl\)), its natural logarithm (\(log(sl)\)), as well as the cosine of the
relative turning angle (\(cos(ta)\)). Because wild dogs follow a diurnal
activity pattern, we furthermore coded a binary variable indicating whether an
observed step was realized during main activity (xx to xx) or low activity (xx
to xx).

\subsection{Movement Model}
We used integrated step selection functions (iSSF) to parametrize a mechanistic
movement model of dispersing wild dogs. In this framework, observed steps are
contrasted to random steps that the animal could have realized, but decided not
to. To compare steps, it is assumed that animals assign a relative selection
score \(w(x)\) to each step. The score depends on the covariates \(X\)
experienced along a step, as well as the animals preferences \(\beta\) towards
these covariates. The probability of a step being realized is then contingent on
the step's selection score, as well as the selection scores of all other step in
the same stratum. In contrast to regular step selection analysis,
\textit{integrated} step selection analysis allows simulatneous inference on
movement and habitat preferences of the studied animal. Moreover, potential
interactions between habitat and movement preferences can be included to
investigate how movement behavior depends on habitat characteristics. In result,
the method produces less biased selection estimates and allows to apply the
resulting model as a fully mechanistic movement model based on which movement
can be simulated. To conduct iSSF analysis, we paired each observed step with 24
random steps. Random steps basically resembled potential alternatives that the
animal could have realized but decided not to. We generated random steps by
sampling random turning angles from a uniform distribution (\(-\pi, +\pi\)) and
step lengths from a gamma distirbution that was fitted to observed steps (scale
= 6'308, shape = 0.37). While the number of random steps is inversely
proportional to the sampling error \citep{Avgar.2016}, we found only minor
differences in model performance when sampling additional random steps and
deemed 24 random steps sufficient. Along each step, we extracted spatial
covariates using the \textit{velox} package and calculated the movement metrics
\(sl\), \(log(sl\)), and \(cos(ta)\). To facilitate model convergence, we
standardized all continuous covariates to a mean of zero and a standard
deviation of one. We then used the r-package \textit{glmmTMB} to fit mixed
effects conditional logistic regression models as proposed by \citep{Muff.2020}.

Our movement model was and extension of the habitat model presented in Hofmann
et al 2021. We will refer to it as the base model. Because the base model was
used to predict landscape permeability, no interactions between the habitat and
movement metrics were modeled. Thus, we expanded the base model and by proposing
additional interactions between movement metrics and environmental covariates.
For this, we started with the base model and iteratively increased model
complexity by adding all proposed two-way interactions between habitat
covariates and movement covariates. For instance, for the covariate
\textit{water} we proposed the interactions \(Water:log(sl)\),
\(Water:log(sl)\), and \(Water:cos(ta)\). Furthermore, we proposed the
interactions \(sl:cos(ta)\) and \(log(sl):cos(ta)\) to account for a correlation
between turning angles and step lengths, as well as the interactions
\(sl:MainActivity\) and \(log(sl):MainActivity\) to account for the fact that
step lengths diffuer due to the diurnal activity pattern. We then ran stepwise
model forward selection based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC,
\citealp{Burnham.2002}) values and identified the most parsimonious movement
model. Although several models received an AIC weight above one, we decided to
only consider the  ``best'' model for simplicity. In either way, the models with
positive weights contained almost identical covariates and an averaged model
would have only given weak support to additional covariates.

\subsection{Source Points}
We randomly placed source points within protected areas larger (\(>\) 700
km\textsuperscript{2}), which conforms to the average home range requirement of
resident wild dogs \citep{Pomilia.2015}. By distributing source points randomly,
the number of source points per km\textsuperscript{2} within protected areas was
approximately equal across our study area. In total, we distributed 50'000
source points across all protected areas, each representing the starting point
of a dispersal trajectory. To render potential immigrants into the study system,
we randomly placed 10'000 additional source points inside a xx km buffer around
the study area. Hence, a total of 60'000 source points were generated, thereby
resulting in 60'000 simulated dispersers. It is worth pointing out that our
choice of  placing source points completely random is arbitrary, as one as well
adjust the sampling frequency based on the density of dispersers in the
respective source area.

% Simulations from step selection functions are known to be sensitive to the
% location of source points, which is why we followed a twofold approach to sample
% release points across the KAZA-TFCA. In a first approach, we used the same 68
% source points between which we already computed least-cost paths and least-cost
% corridors (see xx). These source points were regularly spaced 100 km apart,
% located within protected areas (\(>\) 700 km\textsuperscript{2}). Because of
% the regulary spacing, not all protected areas received source points. Hence, we
% placed additional source points at the center of such protected areas. At each
% of the generated source point we released 1000 dispersers, implying a total of
% 68'000 simulated dispersers. In a second approach, we used the same 68 source
% points to define catchment areas inside protected areas. That is, for each of
% the 68 source points we defined its voronoi polygon within the point's protected
% area. Within these catchment areas we then randomly sampled 1000 new source
% points from which we released another 68'000 dispersers. Overall, we simulated
% 134'000 dispersers for a total of 268 Mio. steps.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Dispersal Simulation}
We used the most parsimonious movement model to simulate a total 80'000
dispersing wild dogs across the KAZA-TFCA. The simulation basically resembled an
inverted iSSF and was set up as follows. First, we sampled a source point at
which a disperser was initiated and assumed a random initial orientation of the
animal. The orientation was essential to permit calculation of relative turning
angles. Second, we generated a set of 25 random steps by sampling turning angles
from a uniform distribution (\(-\pi, +\pi\)) and step lengths from the fitted
gamma distribution. Similarly to our input data, each step corresponded to a
temporal difference of 4 hours. To prevent unrealistically large steps, we
capped sampled step lengths at 35km, which corresponds to the farthest distance
travelled by one of our dispersers within 4 hours. Third, along each random step
we extracted habitat covariates and calculated movement covariates. Fourth, we
applied the parametrized movement model to predict the selection scores \(w(x)\)
for all steps. Fifth, we translated selection scores into probabilities by
applying \Cref{EQ2}. Sixth, we sampled one of the random steps based on assigned
probabilities and determined the animal's new position. We then repeated steps
two to six until a total of 2'000 steps were realized.

Inevitably, some simulated dispersers would approach a map boundary and one of
the generated random steps would leave the study area. However, beyond the study
area no covariates could be extracted and no selection scores can be calculated.
To mitigate the influence of such edge effects, we buffered all covariate layers
by xx percent and filled the buffer zone with covariate values resampled from
the observed data. As such, simulated dispersers were allowed to leave and
reenter the study area through this buffer zone. In case one of the proposed
random steps left the buffer, we resampled the corresponding step until it lied
fully within the buffer zone. This implies that we forced the disperser to
bounce off the borders of the buffer zone.

To meaningfully select source points, we randomly sampled coordinates within
protected areas larger (\(>\) 700 km\textsuperscript{2}), which conforms to the
average home range requirement of resident wild dogs \citep{Pomilia.2015}. By
distributing source points randomly, the number of source points per
km\textsuperscript{2} within protected areas was approximately equal. In total,
we distributed 50'000 source points across protected areas. To render potential
immigrants into the study area, we placed 10'000 additional random points inside
a xx km buffer around the study area. In total, we generated 80'000 source
points, thereby resulting in 80'000 simulated dispersers, each of which moved
2'000 steps. Overall, this implied 160 Mio. simulated steps.

\subsection{Heatmaps}
Using the simulated trajectories, we created heatmaps that indicate the
frequency at which each raster-cell in the study area was visited. If the same
trajectory crossed a pixel twice, it was only counted once, i.e. we did not
consider revisits. We achieved high performance rasterization of all simulated
trajectories using the recently developed R-package \textit{terra}
\citep{Hijmans.2020}.


To examine if and how ``heat'' changes in response to changes in the location of
source points and the number of simulated steps, we followed a 2 x 6 design and
created heatmaps for both point sampling regines, as well as for 68, 125, 250,
500, 1000, and 2000 dispersal steps. We quantified the similarity of the
resulting 12 heatmaps to the permeability and least-cost corridor maps presented
in (Hofmann ...) we used Bhattacharyya's affinity. Bhattacharyya's affinity
ranges from zero (complete separation) to one (perfect match) and has earlier
been proposed to compare the overlap of utilisation distributions (Fieberg).


\subsection{Network Analysis}
We coerced all simulated trajectories into a network consisting of vertices
(relocations) and edges (connections between relocations). To do so, we created
raster layers at multiple resolutions and identified each trajectory's
transition matrix on these rasters see figure xx \citep{BastilleRousseau.2018}.
We then merged the transition matrices of all trajectories and calculated
cumulative transitions between all raster-cells. This resulted in an edge-list,
containing all observed from-to connections as well as their frequency. Using
this edge-list, we generated a weighted graph using the r-package
\textit{igraph}. Based on this graph we calculated betweenness scores as well as
the degree of each raster cell. Betweenness indicates how often a specific
raster-cell lies on a shortest path between two other raster-cells and is a
useful metric to detect movement corridors. Degree, on the other hand, indicates
how many connections a raster cell has and therefore serves to illustrate the
xxx of specific nodes. When calculating betweenness, we used the transition
frequency as weighting factor. That is, a higher transition frequency
contributed to a higher betweenness score.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Movement Model}
Compared to the base model, the most parsimonious movement model included
several additional interactions (\Cref{MovementModel} and Table S1). The model
indicates that dispersers move directional, particularly when distant to water,
yet less so in human dominated landscapes. Furthermore, dispersers prefer large
steps, especially during main activity. In contrast, step lengths tend to be
shorter when water- or tree-cover is high. In general, dispersers avoid water,
prefer proximity to water, avoid dense tree-cover, prefer shrubs/grassland, and,
finally, avoid human dominated landscapes.

\subsection{Dispersal Simulation}

\subsection{Heatmaps}
Six of the twelve rasterized dispersal trajectories are presented as heatmaps in
\Cref{Heatmaps}. As can be seen, differences that stem from the method of point
sampling disappear as more steps are simulated. This is to be expected as the
influence of the origin becomes smaller and smaller as the animal moves through
the landscape. However, there are striking differences when simualtions are only
run for few iterations.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_Heatmaps}
  \caption{}
  \label{Heatmaps}
\end{figure}

Bhattacharyya's affinity index supports the notion that heatmaps become more
similar to the earlier developed permeability and corridor maps as the number of
simulated steps increases. Furthermore, it appears that randomly sampled source
points contribute to a higher similarity too, albeit differences due to the
sampling regime vanish as the number of simulated steps increases. In fact, both
maps are almost identical to each other after 2000 steps. Furthermore, the
connectivity networks become increasingly similar to the previously published
permeability and corridor maps. Still, some differences remain even after 2000
simulated steps, highlighting that some severe impediments in the landscape
exist.

\subsection{Network Analysis}


\section{Discussion}
Our connectivity network further suggests that dispersers from the Okavango
Delta more likely disperse towards east than west. Indeed, only x out of our y
observed dispersers ever reached the western part of the delta. Only when the
flood retracts a small pathway between the city of Maun and the floodwaters of
the delta emerges and enables dispersers to move towards the detal's western
part.

Empircally informed dispersal models will also be invaluable in spatially
explicit population models in which dispersal is actually rendered
mechanistically.

In addition, individual based simulations will allow to explicitly model
dispersal between subpopulations in models of population dynamics.

In this regard, our approach is rather similar to dispersal kernels, yet it
enables to render directional biases, which are currently difficult to implement
using such methods.

We completely randomized the location of source points within protected areas.
However, in some cases prior knowledge about the density of potential dispersers
is available and can be used to adjust the number of simulated individuals
accordingly. Alternatively, instead of tweaking the number of simulated
individuals, one could assign a weight to each trajectory that depends on the
density of potential dispersers in the source areas. As such, trajectories from
areas with high density would enter the heatmap with above average weigth.

The parametrized movement model could also be manipulated to investigate how
different habitat preferences influence landscape connectivity and to test the
sensitivity of results with respect to the exact preferences of individuals.

One of the major benefits of individual-based simulations is the ability to make
the temporal dimension of movement explicit. This allows to investigate how
connectivity depends on the dispersal duration, something that is not possible
with traditional least-cost or circuit theory methods.

Optimally, one should simulate additional dispersers until the amount of newly
gained information lies beyond a certain threshold, i.e. until some sort of
convergence is achieved. However, due to the myriad of outcomes in movement
behavior, this would often imply countless repetitions for each source points at
each location where dispersal is possibly initiated. This is computationally
infeasible.

Our work suggests that the selection of source points significantly impacts
resulting connectivity networks. Especially when dispersal durations are short,
wrongly placed source points lead to vastly different results. Signer et al.
used estimated utilisation distributions by means of simulated movements. They
used a rather long burn in period prior to alleviate the problem of selecting
meaningful source points. However, this approach only works when individuals
move around a point of attraciton. This is typically not the case when
simulating dispersers, introducing an important trade-off. The researcher can
decide to increase the number of simulated steps, hence reducing the influence
of starting locations, yet this also inevitably increases estimated
connectivity.

Comparable simulations could also serve to predict the likely whereabouts of
dispersers as they move. This information can then be utilized as an  ``early
warning'' system, such that potential encounters can be gauged ad hoc.
