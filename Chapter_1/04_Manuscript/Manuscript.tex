\begin{abstract}
Dispersal is an important process that allows species to avoid inbreeding,
colonize new habitats and reinforce non-viable subpopulations. Successful
dispersal thus represents a crucial pre-requisite for long-term species
persistence in wild animal populations. However, the ability to disperse is
contingent a sufficient degree of landscape connectivity, which is why the
estimation of connectivity and preservation of dispersal corridors has become a
task of extraordinary importance for conservation authorities worldwide.

Over the past two decades, ecologists have primarily relied on analytical tools
such as least-cost analysis and circuit theory to model and investigate
landscape connectivity. Despite their usefulness for a diverse suite of
ecological applications, both methods make several restricting assumptions that
limit their suitability in reality. Individual-based dispersal simulations have
been proposed to address these shortcomings, yet due to the sheer amount of
non-trivial modeling decisions decisions required, a unified and objective
framework to simulate dispersal is missing.

Recent innovations in movement ecology have brought forward novel opportunities
to study animal dispersal and estimate landscape connectivity. In particular,
the rich suite of resource selection functions, namely point-, step-, and
path-selection functions, have undergone substantial improvements over the past
years. Most notably, step-selection functions have been generalized to
\textit{integrated} step selection functions, which essentially represent fully
mechanistic movement models based on which an individual's movement could be
simulated. While such models have been applied to study \textit{steady-state}
utilization distribution resident animals, a similar approach may be useful to
investigate \textit{transient} movement behavior and landscape connectivity.

Here, we showcase the use of integrated step selection functions as a simple
individual-based and spatially explicit model to simulate dispersal of the
endangered African wild dog across the world's largest transboundary
conservation area, the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area
(KAZA-TFCA). For this, we utilize data collected on 16 dispersing wild dog
coalitions in combination with relevant habitat covariates. We analyse the data
using integrated step selection functions, thereby parametrizing a fully
mechanistic movement model describing how dispersing wild dogs move through the
landscape. Based on this model, we simulate 80'000 dispersers moving across the
extent of the KAZA-TFCA. and generate a set of maps, each focused on a different
aspect of connectivity. Finally, we discuss the benefits and pitfalls of such a
simulation-based approach and highlight potential improvements to be made in the
future.

\section{Introduction}

% Importance of Dispersal & Connectivity
\subsection{Importance of Dispersal \& Connectivity (90\%)}
Dispersal is defined as the movement of individuals away from their natal
location to the site of first reproduction \cite{Howard.1960}. It is a vital
process governing the social structure of wild animal populations that are
distributed in space \citep{Hanski.1998, Clobert.2012} and may strongly affect
population dynamics at different spatial and social scales \citep{Hanski.1999a,
Clobert.2012}. Dispersal allows species to maintain genetic diversity
\citep{Perrin.1999, Perrin.2000, Frankham.2002, Leigh.2012, Baguette.2013}, to
rescue small, non-viable populations \citep{Brown.1977}, and to promote the
colonization or recolonization of unoccupied habitats \citep{Hanski.1999b,
MacArthur.2001}. However, successful dispersal requires a sufficient degree of
landscape connectivity \citep{Fahrig.2003, Clobert.2012}, which is why the
identification and protection of major dispersal corridors has become a
fundamental task in conservation science \citep{Nathan.2008, Doerr.2011,
Rudnick.2012}. The ability to pinpoint relevant dispersal hotspots requires
information on movement behavior during dispersal and knowledge about factors
that limit dispersal and therefore connectivity \citep{Baguette.2013,
Vasudev.2015}.

% Advancements in GPS Technology & Movement Ecology
\subsection{Advancements in GPS Technology \& Movement Ecology (90\%)}
Thanks to novel technologies developed over the past decades, particularly of
GPS/Satellite radio-collars, the use of GPS data to study animal dispersal and
connectivity has accelerated \citep{Elliot.2014, Jonsson.2016, Williams.2019}.
Additionally, the advent of publicly accessible satellite imagery and
sophisticated remote sensing techniques to represent the physical landscape
through which individuals disperse have heralded a ``golden age of animal
tracking'' \citep{Kays.2015}. Concurrently, the availability of large amounts of
empirical data and an increased computational power have led to the development
of numerous techniques to study dispersal and highlight critical corridors
between subpopulations \citep{Boyce.2002, Fortin.2005, Cushman.2010,
Zeller.2012, Diniz.2020}.

% Resource Selection & Connectivity
\subsection{Resource Selection \& Connectivity (90\%)}
\textit{Resource selection functions} \citep{Boyce.2002} and derived methods
such as \textit{step selection functions} \citep{Fortin.2005} and \textit{path
selection functions} \citep{Cushman.2010} have proven particularly useful for
studying animal movement \citep{Fieberg.2020} and modeling connectivity
\citep{Diniz.2020}. These methods allow estimating habitat preferences of the
focal species by comparing covariates at locations visited by the animal to the
same covariates at locations available to, but not visited by the animal
\citep{Boyce.2002, Fortin.2005, Cushman.2010, Thurfjell.2014}. The so estimated
preferences can then be used to predict a permeability surface, indicating the
expected ease at which an animal can traverse a given area \citep{Spear.2010,
Zeller.2012, Etherington.2016}. Ultimately, the permeability surface serves as
input to a connectivity model that is used to reveal movement corridors
\citep{Diniz.2020}. Two of the most prominent connectivity models are least-cost
path analysis (LCP analysis; \citealp{Adriaensen.2003}) and circuit theory (CT;
\citealp{McRae.2006, McRae.2008}), both graph-based methods that estimate
conductance of the landscape to infer likely movement corridors. Despite their
intuitive nature and ease of use, both methods make rigorous assumptions about
animal movement that are often not fulfilled in reality \citep{Diniz.2020}.

% Issues with Least-Cost Paths & Circuit Theory
\subsection{Issues with Least-Cost Paths (90\%)}
In LCP analysis, for instance, a least costly path always exists, even if
associated movement costs are unreasonably high and will never be incurred by a
dispersing individual. The method also presumes that animals have an infinite
perceptual range and a preconceived end-point in mind, such that they choose a
cost-minimizing route accordingly. These assumptions may be fulfilled by
migrating animals that typically move between a discrete set of habitats through
familiar landscapes. Dispersers, on the other hand, usually move over long
distances into unknown territory and are therefore less likely to be aware of
associated movement costs \citep{Koen.2014, Abrahms.2017, Cozzi.2020}. Another
issue of LCPs analysis concerns the fact that least-costly routes, by their very
nature, are only one pixel wide \citep{Pinto.2009}. This neglects the fact that
alternative routes with similar costs may exist and implies that the width of
inferred movement routes depends on the resolution of chosen covariate layers
and may not be biologically meaningful \citep{Diniz.2020}. Although some of
these deficiencies can be addressed using less stringent versions of the LCP
algorithm (e.g. least-cost \textit{corridors} \citep{Pinto.2009},
\textit{thresholded} least-cost paths \citep{Landguth.2012}, and
\textit{randomized} least-cost paths \citep{Panzacchi.2016, VanMoorter.2021}), a
certain degree of arbitrariness remains.

\subsection{Issues with Circuit Theory (90\%)}
CT entails similarly unreasonable restrictions that are hardly ever met. For
example, because CT only allows movements from a source cell to its 4 or 8
adjacent cells, it implicitly posits that animals exhibit a perceptual range of
a single pixel. Given that covariate layers are usually resolved with a pixel
size between 30 m x 30 m and 1 km x 1 km, this hardly ever renders the true
capability of animals to perceive the environment. Moreover, CT is built around
the assumption of a complete random walk \citep{Diniz.2020}, entailing that
directional biases cannot be rendered. Nevertheless, directionality is a common
characteristic in animal movement \citep{Bovet.1991, Schultz.2001}, especially
in dispersing individuals \citep{Cozzi.2020, Hofmann.2021}.

\subsection{Issues of Both Methods}
Finally, neither LCP analysis nor CT are capable of rendering the temporal
dimension of dispersal \citep{Diniz.2020}. Statements about the expected
duration required to traverse a certain corridor are therefore impossible.
Likewise, because movement is not modeled explicitly, interactions between
movement and habitat preferences of the focal species cannot be rendered.
Connectivity therefore merely arises in result to the landscape structure, which
is usually referred to as structural connectivity. While structural connectivity
yields insights in the \textit{potential} of the landscape to be traversed, it
does not enable to quantify the \textit{actual} gene flow through the area.
Consequently, a functional view on connectivity, which also renders the
behavioral response of the animal with respect to prevailing habitat conditions,
is often more desirable \citep{Tischendorf.2000, Baguette.2013}.

% What about IBMMs?
\subsection{What about IBMMs? (90\%)}
To address the issues inherent to LCPs and CT, individual-based movement models
(IBMMs) have been proposed and applied \citep{Diniz.2020}. In these models,
dispersal trajectories are simulated spatially explicitly, based on movement
rules that determine how individuals move over and interact with the prevailing
landscape \citep{Gustafson.1996, Gardner.2004, Graf.2007, KramerSchadt.2004,
Revilla.2004, Revilla.2008, Kanagaraj.2013, Clark.2015, Allen.2016,
Hauenstein.2019, Zeller.2020, Vasudev.2021}. Using the simulated trajectories,
one can calculate a set of connectivity metrics, such as inter-patch
connectivity and traversal frequency, to reveal major dispersal corridors
\citep{Kanagaraj.2013, BastilleRousseau.2018, Hauenstein.2019, Zeller.2020}.
However, while IBMMS can be employed to overcome any of the shortcomings
intrinsic to LCPs and CT, they are subject to a vast amount of subjective,
non-trivial modeling decisions. Moreover, they can be challenging to fit and
require vast amounts of movement data, ideally collected during dispersal
\citep{Diniz.2020}. Consequently, alternative methods that require fewer
modeling decisions and are straight forward to apply are desirable.

% Step Selection Analysis
\subsection{Step Selection Analysis (90\%)}
Here, we investigate the usefulness of integrated step selection functions
(ISSFs, \citealp{Avgar.2016}), as a relatively simple but powerful IBMM based on
which dispersal can be simulated. While regular SSFs were intended to learn
about relative habitat preferences of the focal species \citep{Fortin.2005,
Thurfjell.2014, Avgar.2017}, the method has recently been generalized to
\textit{integrated} SSFs and now enables to jointly study habitat and movement
preferences, as well as potential interactions between them \citep{Avgar.2016,
Signer.2017, Fieberg.2020}. ISSFs therefore provide a relatively simple means to
model complex movement behavior, where movement is viewed as the result of two
intertwined behavioral kernels (e.g. \citealp{Prokopenko.2017, Munden.2020}).
Importantly, a parametrized ISSF model can be employed as a fully mechanistic
movement model based on which individual movement trajectories can be simulated
\citep{Avgar.2016, Signer.2017}. In fact, \cite{Signer.2017} used ISSF to
simulate steady state utilization distributions of resident animals that were
moving around a point of attraction. However, the degree to which such
simulations are helpful in detecting movement corridors and modeling landscape
connectivity remains to be investigated.

% Study Species & Study Area
\subsection{Study Species \& Study Area (90\%)}
One of the species for which long-term viability relies on sufficient landscape
connectivity is the endangered African wild dog \textit{Lycon pictus}. While
once present across entire sub-Saharan Africa, wild dogs have disappeared from a
vast majority of their historic range due to persecution by humans, habitat
fragmentation and destruction, and deadly diseases \citep{Woodroffe.2012}. As of
today, only 6'000 free-ranging individuals remain in small and spatially
scattered subpopulations \citep{Woodroffe.2012}. Within those subpopulations,
wild dogs form cohesive packs comprising 8 to 12 adults and their offspring
\cite{McNutt.1995}. After reaching sexual maturity, male and female offspring
form same-sex coalitions and disperse from their natal pack in search for
potential mating partners and a suitable territory to settle \citep{McNutt.1996,
Behr.2020}. New packs are formed when dispersing coalitions join unrelated
opposite-sex dispersing coalitions \citep{McNutt.1996}. Dispersing wild dogs can
cover several hundred kilometers across a variety of landscapes
\citep{DaviesMostert.2012, Masenga.2016, Cozzi.2020, Hofmann.2021}. One of the
few strongholds for this species lies near the Moremi Game Reserve in northern
Botswana, which is part of the world's largest transboundary protected area,
namely the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA-TFCA). This
area has originally been intended to facilitate migration of elephants, but is
expected to provide benefits to a multitude of other species \citep{Elliot.2014,
Brennan.2020, Hofmann.2021}.

% Previous Paper
\subsection{Previous Paper (90\%)}
In a previous study, we assessed landscape connectivity for dispersing African
wild dogs within the KAZA-TFCA using least-cost methods \citep{Hofmann.2021}.
Specifically, we fitted a basic habitat selection model and predicted a
permeability surface that we used to compute least-cost paths and corridors. We
now expand on this knowledge and use ISSFs to develop a more mechanistic
movement model of dispersing wild dogs (\Cref{GraphicalAbstract}). We employ the
model to simulate dispersers moving across the KAZA-TFCA and generate three
distinct connectivity maps, each shedding light onto a different aspect of
connectivity. With this work, we exemplify how ISSFs can be utilized for
dispersal simulations and we discuss several benefits of this approach over
traditional connectivity modeling techniques such as least-cost analyses and
circuit theory. Most importantly, simulations based on ISSFs provide a more
generic view on how connectivity emerges and to which degree connectivity
depends on the dispersal duration. In addition, by generating proper dispersal
trajectories, network theory can be applied to calculate network metrics that
are pertinent to connectivity analysis.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Study Area (90\%)}
The study area was defined by a bounding box centered at -17\degree 13'9''S,
23\degree 56'4''E (\Cref{StudyArea}a) stretching over 1.3 Mio.
km\textsuperscript{2} and encompassing the entire KAZA-TFCA (\Cref{StudyArea}b).
The KAZA-TFCA represents the world's largest transboundary conservation area and
comprises parts of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. It covers a
total of 520'000 km\textsuperscript{2} and hosts diverse landscapes, ranging
from savanna to grassland and from dry to moist woodland habitats. In its center
lies the Okavango Delta, a dominant hydrogeographical feature and the world's
largest flood-pulsing inland delta. The wet season within the KAZA-TFCA lasts
from November to March and is out of phase with the flood in the Okavango Delta,
which peaks between July and August \citep{McNutt.1996, Wolski.2017}. Although
large portions within the KAZA-TFCA are designated national parks or other
protected areas, considerable human influence remains due to roads, agricultural
sites and settlements and villages that are distributed across the KAZA-TFCA's
landscape.

    this study was collected on a free-ranging African wild dog population
    inhabiting the Moremi National Park in northern Botswana.}
    \label{StudyArea}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{GPS Relocation Data (90\%)}
Between 2011 and 2019, we collected GPS relocation data on dispersing wild dogs
from a free-ranging wild dog population inhabiting the Moremi National Park in
northern Botswana \citep{Cozzi.2020, Hofmann.2021}. We selected potential
dispersers based on age, pack size, number of same‐sex siblings within the pack,
and presence of unrelated opposite-sex individuals in the pack
\citep{McNutt.1996, Behr.2020}. We immobilized selected individuals using a
cocktail of Ketamine/Xylazine/Atropine \citep{Osofsky.1996, Cozzi.2020} that was
injected by dart, fired from a CO\textsubscript{2}-pressurized gun
(\textit{DAN-Inject, Denmark}). Immobilized individuals were fitted with
GPS/Satellite radio collars (\textit{Vertex Lite; Vectronic Aerospace GmbH,
Berlin}) that guaranteed automated drop-off through a decomposable piece of
cotton. Handling and collaring of all individuals was supervised by a
Botswana-registered wildlife veterinarian and all individuals quickly rejoined
their pack after immobilization.

16 collared individuals eventually dispersed, each in a separate same-sex
dispersal coalition (7 female and 9 male coalitions). During dispersal, collars
were programmed to record a GPS fix every 4 hours, all of which were regularly
transmitted over the Iridium satellite system, thereby allowing to remotely
track individuals, even if they left the main study area and crossed
international borders. Because behavior during dispersal is more pertinent for
assessing landscape connectivity \citep{Elliot.2014, Abrahms.2017}, we discarded
all data that was collected during residency and only retained GPS data recorded
during dispersal. In some instances, exact dispersal dates were known from field
observations, whereas in other cases we determined dispersal phases using the
net-squared displacement metric. Net squared displacement measures the squared
Euclidean distance of a GPS relocation to a reference point \citep{Borger.2012},
which in our case was set to the center of each individual's natal home range.
Thus, dispersal was deemed to have started when an individual left its natal
home range and ended once individuals became sedentary again. As previous
research found no differences in behaviors of females and males during dispersal
\citep{Woodroffe.2019, Cozzi.2020}, we did not distinguish between sexes. After
collection, we converted collected GPS coordinates (n = 4'169) to steps, where
each step represented the straight-line distance traveled by an individual
between two consecutive GPS relocations \citep{Turchin.1998}. To ensure a
regular sampling interval, we removed fixes that were not successfully collected
on the 4-hourly schedule (\( \pm \) 15 minutes).

\subsection{Covariates (90\%)}
We represented the physical landscape across the study area using a set of
habitat covariates that included water-cover, distance to water, woodland-cover,
and shrub/grassland-cover. Because water cover greatly changes within and
between years in the Okavango Delta, we applied a remote sensing algorithm and
generated frequently updated water cover layers and corresponding distance to
water layers (see \citealp{Wolski.2017} and Appendix A3 in
\citealp{Hofmann.2021}). Resulting water layers thus temporally aligned with our
dispersal events. We furthermore computed a proxy for human influence, rendering
anthropogenic pressures stemming from human-density, agricultural sites, and
roads. All spatial layers were coarsened or interpolated to a target resolution
of 250 m by 250 m. Further details on the sources and preparation of each
habitat covariate are given in \cite{Hofmann.2021}.

Besides habitat covariates, we computed movement metrics that we used as
movement covariates in our models. Movement metrics were calculated for each
step and included the step length (\textsf{sl}), its natural logarithm
(\textsf{log(sl)}), and the cosine of the relative turning angle
(\textsf{cos(ta)}) (for details see \citep{Avgar.2016, Fieberg.2020}). Because
wild dogs follow a diurnal activity pattern, we also coded a binary variable
(\textsf{LowActivity}) indicating whether a step was realized during periods of
low wild dog activity (17:00 to 09:00 local time) or high wild dog activity
(09:00 to 17:00 local time). Handling and manipulation of all data, as well as
all models and simulations were implemented with the statistical software {\tt
R}, version 3.6.6 \citep{R.2019}. Several helper functions were written in {\tt
C++} and imported into {\tt R} using the {\tt Rcpp} package
\citep{Eddelbuettel.2011, Eddelbuettel.2013}

\subsection{Movement Model (80\%)}
We used ISSFs to parametrize a mechanistic movement model for dispersing wild
dogs \citep{Avgar.2016}. To conduct ISSF analysis, we paired each realized step
with 24 random steps. An observed step plus its 24 random steps formed a stratum
and received a unique identifier. As suggested by \cite{Avgar.2016}, we
generated random steps by sampling random turning angles from a uniform
distribution (\(-\pi, +\pi\)) and step lengths from a gamma distribution that
was fitted to realized steps (scale = 6'308, shape = 0.37). Along each step, we
extracted and averaged spatial covariates using the {\tt velox} package
\citep{Hunziker.2021}. We also calculated the movement metrics \textsf{sl},
\textsf{log(sl)}, and \textsf{cos(ta)} for each observed and random step. To
facilitate model convergence, we standardized all continuous covariates to a
mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Since correlation among covariates
was low (\(|r| > 0.6\); \citealp{Latham.2011}), we retained all of them for
modeling.

To contrast realized steps (scored 1) and random steps (scored 0), we assumed
that animals assigned a selection score \(w(x)\) of the exponential form to each
step \citep{Fortin.2005}. The selection score \(w(x)\) of each step thus
depended on its associated covariates (\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)) and on the
animal's preferences (i.e. relative selection strengths; \citealp{Avgar.2017})
towards these covariates (\(\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n\)):

\begin{equation}
\label{EQ1}
  w(x) = exp(\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n)
\end{equation}

The probability of a step being realized was then contingent on the step's
selection score, as well as on the selection scores of all other step in the
same stratum:

\begin{equation}
\label{EQ2}
  P(Y_{i} = 1 | Y_{1} + Y_{2} + ... + Y_{i} = 1) =
  \frac{w(x_{i})}{w(x_{1}) + w(x_{2}) + ... + w(x_{i})}
\end{equation}

We ran conditional logistic regression analysis in the r-package {\tt glmmTMB}
to estimate preferences of interest. To handle multiple individuals, we applied
the mixed effects technique developed by \citep{Muff.2020}, which allows to
effectively model random slopes. Thus, we treated animal IDs as random effect
and modeled random slopes for each covariate. We fixed the random intercept
variance at an arbitrary high value of 10\textsuperscript{6} to make use of the
``poission''-trick \citep{Muff.2020}.

The structure of the movement model was based on the habitat selection model for
dispersing wild dogs presented in \cite{Hofmann.2021}. In the original model
(referred to as base model hereafter), no interactions between habitat
covariates (\textsf{Water, DistanceToWater\textsuperscript{0.5}, Woodland,
Shrubs/Grassland, Human Influence}) and movement covariates (\textsf{sl,
log(sl), cos(ta)}) were considered. Hence, we slightly expanded this base model
and proposed interactions between all movement and habitat covariates. More
specifically, we started with the base model and incrementally increased model
complexity by adding all possible two-way interactions between habitat
covariates and movement covariates. For instance, for the covariate
\textsf{Water}, we proposed the interactions \textsf{Water:log(sl)},
\textsf{Water:log(sl)}, and \textsf{Water:cos(ta)}. Besides those combinations,
we also proposed the interactions \textsf{sl:cos(ta)} and
\textsf{log(sl):cos(ta)} to account for a correlation between turning angles and
step lengths, as well as the interactions \textsf{sl:LowActivity} and
\textsf{log(sl):LowActivity} to account for the fact that step lengths may
differ due to wild dogs' diurnal activity pattern. To compare competing models
and assess the most parsimonious movement model, we ran stepwise forward model
selection based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC, \citealp{Burnham.2002}).

We validated the predictive power of the most parsimonious movement model using
k-fold cross-validation for case-control studies as suggested by
\cite{Fortin.2009}. For this, we randomly assigned 80\% of the strata to a
training set and the remaining 20\% to a testing set. Using the training data we
parametrized a movement model based on which we predicted selection scores
\(w(x)\) for all steps in the test data. Within each stratum, we then assigned
ranks 1-25 to each step based on predicted selection scores, where rank 1 was
given to the step with the highest score \(w(x)\). Across all strata we
determined the realized step's rank and we calculated rank frequencies of
realized steps across all strata. Finally, we computed Spearman's rank
correlation between ranks and associated frequencies \(r_{s, realized}\). We
replicated the entire procedure 100 times and computed the mean correlation
coefficient (\(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\)), as well as its 95\% confidence interval
across all replicates. For comparison, we repeated the same procedure 100 times
assuming random preferences, which we implemented by discarding the realized
step from all strata and identifying the rank of a random step in each stratum.
Again, we calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\(r_{s,
random}\)), its mean across repetitions (\(\bar{r}_{s, random}\)), and its 95\%
confidence interval. This validation ultimately proofs a significant prediction
in case the confidence intervals of \(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\) and \(\bar{r}_{s,
random}\) do not overlap.

\subsection{Dispersal Simulation (80\%)}
We used the most parsimonious movement model to simulate 80'000 virtual
dispersers moving across the KAZA-TFCA. The simulation resembled an inverted
ISSF and was set up as follows. (1) We defined a random source point and assumed
a random initial orientation of the animal. (2) Departing from the source point,
we generated 25 random steps by sampling turning angles from a uniform
distribution (\(-\pi, +\pi\)) and step lengths from our fitted gamma
distribution. Similar to the input data, each random step represented the
straight line movement within 4 hours. To prevent unreasonably large steps, we
capped sampled step lengths to a maximum of 35 km, which corresponded to the
farthest distance ever traveled within 4 hours by one of our dispersers. (3)
Along each random step, we extracted and averaged habitat covariates and we
calculated movement covariates. To ensure compatible scales, we standardized
extracted values using the same parameters applied to our input data. (4) We
applied the parametrized movement model to predict the selection score \(w(x)\)
for each step and we translated predicted scores into probabilities using
\Cref{EQ2}. (5) We sampled one of the random steps based on predicted
probabilities and determined the animal's new position. We repeated steps (2) to
(5) until 2'000 steps were realized, implying a total 160 Mio. simulated steps.

To minimize the influence of edge effects and to deal with random steps leaving
the study area, we followed \citep{Koen.2010} and artificially expanded all
covariate layers by adding a 100 km wide buffer zone. Within the buffer zone, we
randomized covariate values by resampling values from the original covariate
layers. Through this buffer zone, simulated dispersers were able to leave and
re-enter the main study area. In cases where proposed random steps transgressed
the border of this buffer zone, we resampled transgressing steps until they
fully lied within the buffer, thereby forcing simulated individuals to ``bounce
off'' such invisible borders.

\subsection{Source Points (90\%)}
We released 80'000 virtual dispersers from 80'000 unique source points
distributed across the study area. 50'000 virtual dispersers were released from
randomly selected source points within contiguous protected areas larger \(>\)
700 km\textsuperscript{2} (\Cref{SourcePoints}a), which conforms to average home
range requirements of resident wild dogs \citep{Pomilia.2015} and allowed us to
remove patches too small to host viable populations. By distributing source
points randomly, the number of source points per km\textsuperscript{2} was
approximately equal within protected areas. To render potential immigrants into
the study system, we released another 30'000 dispersers at random locations
inside the 100 km wide buffer zone surrounding the main study area
(\Cref{SourcePoints}b).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{99_SourceAreas.png}
    \caption{(a) Different source areas from which we released virtual
    dispersers. We only considered contiguous protected areas (national parks,
    game reserves, and forest reserves) that were larger than 700
    km\textsuperscript{2} (green). This area corresponds to the average home
    range requirement for viable wild dog populations \citep{Pomilia.2015}. To
    render potential immigrants into the study system, we also initiated
    dispersers within a buffer zone (blue) surrounding the main study area. (b)

    released from the main study area (green dots) and another 30'000 dispersers
    within the virtual buffer (blue dots).}
    \label{SourcePoints}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Convergence (80\%)}
To verify that the number of simulated individuals sufficed to ensure reliable
estimates of connectivity, we evaluated how the relative traversal frequency
across the landscape depended on the number of simulated trajectories.
Specifically, we distributed 1'000 squared ``checkpoints'', each with an extent
of 5 km x 5 km at random locations inside the main study area. We then
determined the relative traversal frequency by simulated trajectories through
each checkpoint for different numbers of simulations (1 to 50'000). We
repeatedly sampled trajectories 100 times and computed the mean traversal
frequency across replicates, as well as the 95\% prediction-interval. We
expected that the mean traversal frequency converges towards a steady state with
increasing simulations.

\subsection{Heatmap (100\%)}
To identify dispersal hotspots across our study area, we created a heatmap
indicating the absolute frequency at which each raster-cell in the study area
was visited by virtual dispersers \citep{Hauenstein.2019, Peer.2008}. For this,
we rasterized all simulated trajectories and tallied them into a single map. If
the same trajectory crossed a raster-cell twice, we only counted it once,
thereby mitigating potential biases caused by individuals that were trapped and
moved in circles. To achieve high performance rasterization, we used the
R-package {\tt terra} \citep{Hijmans.2020}.

\subsection{Betweenness (80\%)}
To pinpoint areas of exceptional relevance for connecting remote regions inside
our study area, we converted simulated trajectories into a network and
calculated betweenness scores \citep{BastilleRousseau.2018}. For this, we
overlaid the study area (including the buffer) with a regular raster resolved at
5 x 5 km. The centerpoint of each raster-cell served as node in the final
network and we used the simulated trajectories to determine all transitions
occurring from one node to another, as well as the frequency at which those
transitions occurred. This resulted in an edge-list that we translated into a
weighted network using the r-package {\tt igraph} \citep{Gabor.2006}. Because
{\tt igraph} handles edge weights (\(\omega\)) as costs, we inverted the
traversal frequency in each cell by applying \(\omega = \frac{\sum_i^n{Traversal
Frequency_i}/n}{Traversal Frequency_i}\). Consequently, edges that were
traversed frequently were assigned low costs. Finally, we used the weighted
network to calculate the betweenness score of each raster-cell. Betweenness
measures how often a specific raster-cell lies on a shortest path between two
other raster-cells and is therefore a useful metric to detect movement corridors
\citep{BastilleRousseau.2018}.

\subsection{Inter-Patch Connectivity (80\%)}
We assessed inter-patch connectivity between national parks located in our study
area to examine functional links between distinct patches in the KAZA-TFCA. The
decision to focus on national parks was purely out of simplicity and does not
imply that connections between other regions are impossible. In fact, the same
logic could easily be expanded to include other protected areas. To quantify
inter-patch connectivity, we computed the relative frequency at which dispersers
originating from one national park successfully moved into another national
park. Successful movement was said to be achieved if the individuals' trajectory
intersected with the corresponding national park at least once. We also recorded
the number of steps required until the first intersection with the polygon of
the respective national park. This allowed us to determine \textit{if} and
\textit{how often} dispersers moved between certain national parks, as well as
\textit{how long} dispersers had to move to realize those connections.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Movement Model (80\%)}
Compared to the base model reported in \citep{Hofmann.2021}, our most
parsimonious movement model retained several additional interactions between
habitat covariates and movement covariates (\Cref{MovementModel} and
\Cref{MovementModelNumbers}). Although several models received an AIC weight
above zero (Table 1 in Appendix S1), we only considered results from the most
parsimonious model for simplicity. All models with positive AIC weight included
similar covariates (Table S1), so this decision only marginally influenced
subsequent analyses. Plots that aid with the interpretation of the final model
are provided in Appendix S2.

Assuming that all other covariates are held constant at their means, the habitat
kernel reveals that dispersing wild dogs avoid water but prefer its proximity.
Similarly, dispersers avoid areas that are covered by woodlands, yet prefer
regions covered by shrublands or grasslands. Finally, dispersers avoid movement
through landscapes that are dominated by humans. Effect sizes are strong and,
except for effect of \textsf{distance to water}, statistically clear on the 5\%
significance level.

With regards to the movement kernel, the positive estimate for \textsf{cos(ta)}
indicates that dispersers move with directional persistence, unlike what was
proposed by the uniform turning angle distribution. Moreover, directionality is
particularly pronounced when dispersers realize large steps (move quickly), as
indicated by the positive estimates for \textsf{cos(ta):sl} and
\textsf{cos(ta):log(sl)}. Finally, the negative estimate for the interaction
\textsf{sl:LowActivity} reveals that wild dogs realize shorter steps (move
slower) outside the main activity periods (during sunrise and sunset). Aside
from the interaction \textsf{sl:LowActivity}, which appears to strongly
influence movmement behavior, effect sizes are moderate, but mostly significant
on the 5\% significance level.

When looking at the interactions between movement and habitat kernels, we
observe that movement behavior is contingent on habitat conditions. For example,
there's strong evidence that dispersers realize smaller steps in areas covered
by water or areas covered by wooldand, yet it appears that steps are larger in
regions dominated by shrubs/grassland, and shorter when the distance to water is
high. Correspondingly, the model suggests that directionality is lower in areas
dominated by humans but more pronounced when dispersers are far from water.
However, except for the effect of \textsf{sl:Water}, effect sizes and
statistical significance are moderate.

The k-fold cross-validation procedure reveals that our model substantially
outperforms a random guess (\Cref{MovementModel}b) and therefore correctly
assigns a high selection score to realized steps. Confidence intervals of
\(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\) and \(\bar{r}_{s, random}\) do not overlap and
therefore proof a reliable prediction. Furthermore, the significant correlation
between ranks and corresponding frequencies for realized steps indicates a good
fit between predictions and observations (\Cref{MovementModel}b). In comparison
to the base model (\(\bar{r}_{s, realized} = -0.55\); \citealp{Hofmann.2021}),
the inclusion of interactions between movement and habitat covariates slightly
improved model performance.

\subsection{Dispersal Simulation (80\%)}
On a machine with an octacore AMD Ryzen 7 2700X processor (8 x 3.6 GHz) and 64
GB of RAM, a batch of 1'000 simulated dispersers moving over 2'000 steps
required 90 minutes to compute (\(\mu = 88.90\), \(\sigma = 1.87\)).
Consequently, the simulation of all 80'000 dispersers (160 Mio. steps)
terminated after 120 hours (i.e. five days). Comparable simulations will be
substantially faster for smaller study areas and lower resolution covariates, as
the covariate extraction from large and high-resolution rasters was
computationally the most demanding task. Out of the 50'000 dispersers initiated
inside the main source area \Cref{SourcePoints}(a), only 4.5\% eventually hit a
map boundary, suggesting that we successfully prevented biases due to boundary
effects. In contrast, 78\% of the 30'000 dispersers originating from the buffer
zone eventually hit a map boundary, yet this was to be expected since many of
those dispersers originated from source points located close to the map
boundary.

\subsection{Convergence (50\%)}
Our examination of the traversal frequency as a function of the number of
simulated dispersers shows that already after a few simulations the mean
traversal frequency remains stable and on average changes only little when
adding further dispersers (\Cref{Convergence} (a) and (b)). While variability
keeps decreasing with additional dispersers, the marginal benefit of having
further dispersers decreases following a negative-exponential trend
(\Cref{Convergence} (c)).

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_Convergence}
    \caption{Relative traversal frequency across 1'000 checkpoints (5 km x 5)
    distributed in the study area. The relative traversal frequency is plotted
    against the number of simulated individuals to visualize how quickly the
    metric converges to a steady state. (a) Replicated (100 times) relative
    traversal frequencies across three randomly chosen checkpoints as well as
    the corresponding 95\% prediction interval (PI). (b) Averaged relative
    traversal frequency across all checkpoints and replicates including a 95\%
    PI. (c) Width of the PI in relation to the number of simulated dispersers.}
    \label{Convergence}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

% On average, step lengths realized by the simulated dispersers (\(\mu_{sl} =
% 2'093\) m, \(\sigma_{sl} = 3'067\)) were slightly shorter than those by observed
% dispersers (\(\mu_{sl} = 2'326\) m, \(\sigma_{sl} = 3'323\)) and simulated
% dispersers moved marginally less directional (\(\mu_{cos(ta)} = 0.057\),
% \(\sigma_{cos(ta)} = 0.071\)) compared to observed dispersers (\(\mu_{cos(ta)} =
% 0.078\), \(\sigma_{cos(ta)} = 0.072\)). These differences in step lengths and
% turning angles can be attributed to minor disparities between habitat conditions
% at the area within which we collected training data and habitat conditions
% within the entire study area.

\subsection{Heatmap (80\%)}
\Cref{Heatmap} depicts the heatmap of all 80'000 simulated trajectories
resulting after 2'000 steps. The map shows that large portions of land beyond
the borders of the KAZA-TFCA are only infrequently visited by dispersers (dark
blue areas), whereas within the KAZA-TFCA several extensive regions are
regularly traversed (bright yellow and red areas). Most notably, the region in
northern Botswana south of the Linyanti swamp stands out as highly frequented
dispersal hotspot. Still, the presence of several massive water bodies, such as
the Okavango Delta, the Makgadikgadi Pan, and the Linyanti swamp, poses
considerable dispersal barriers that limit realized connectivity within the
KAZA-TFCA. Similarly, dispersal across Zambia's and Zimbabwe's part of the
KAZA-TFCA appears to be limited, as only few areas are successfully traversed by
dispersers. This can largely be attributed to substantial human influences
resulting from high human density, roads, and agricultural activities in these
areas. Outside the KAZA-TFCA, the most heavily used regions include the areas
inside the Central Kalahari National Park in Botswana, the area south-west of
the Khaudum National Park in Namibia, and the area around the Liuwa Plains
National Park in Zambia.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_Heatmap.png}
  \caption{Heatmap showing traversal frequencies of 80'000 simulated dispersers
  moving 2'000 steps across the KAZA-TFCA. Simulations were based on an
  integrated step selection model that we fit to the movement data of dispersing
  African wild dogs. To generate the heatmap, we rasterized and tallied all
  simulated trajectories. Consequently, the map highlights areas that are
  frequently traversed by virtual dispersers. Additional heatmaps showing the
  traversal frequency for different numbers of simulated steps are provided in
  Appendix S3.}
  \label{Heatmap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Betweenness (80\%)}
Betweenness scores after 2'000 simulated steps are presented in
\Cref{Betweenness} and reveal a set of discrete dispersal corridors. Again, the
region in northern Botswana stands out as crucial dispersal hub that connects
more remote regions in the study system. Towards east, the extension of this
corridor runs through the Chobe National Park into the Hwange national park.
From there, a further extension connects to the distant Matusadona National Park
in Zimbabwe. Northwest of the Linyanty ecosystem, a major corridor expands into
Angola, where it splits and finally traverses over a long stretch of unprotected
area into the Kafue National Park in Zambia. Several additional corridors with
slightly lower betweenness scores exist, yet most of them run within the
boundaries of the KAZA-TFCA. In general, only few corridors directly link the
peripheral regions of the KAZA-TFCA. For instance, there are only few corridors
between the Matusadona National Park in Zimbabwe and the Kafue National Park in
Zimbabwe. Similarly, there are no direct links between the Zimbabwean and
Angolan ``spikes'' of the KAZA-TFCA.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_Betweenness.png}
  \caption{Map of betweenness scores, highlighting distinct dispersal corridors
  and potential bottlenecks. A high betweenness score indicates that the
  respective cells are exceptionally relevant in connecting different regions in
  the study area. That is, the higher the betweenness score, the more often a
  pixel lies on a shortest path between adjacent areas. In this sense the metric
  can be used to pinpoint discrete movement corridors. Note that we
  square-rooted betweenness scores to improve visibility of corrdiors with low
  scores. Betweenness scores were determined by converting simulated dispersal
  trajectories into a large network. Note that we square-rooted betweenness
  scores to improve the visibility of corridors with low betweenness scores.}
  \label{Betweenness}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Inter-Patch Connectivity (80\%)}
Results from the analysis of inter-patch connectivity are given in
\Cref{AreasReached}. The figure shows all realized links by simulated dispersers
between national parks and indicates the average duration a disperser had to
move to realize those links. It is again worth pointing out that the figure is
only intended as an example and for clarity we only consider connectivity
between national parks (NPs), albeit plenty of links between other protected
areas exist. As can be seen from the number and thicknesses of arrows,
inter-patch connectivity between NPs in Angola, Namibia, and Botswana is
comparably high. In addition, the bright colors highlight that most dispersal
events between those areas are short. In contrast, we see that connections into
the Kafue NP in Zambia require more steps and are fewer in general. Similarly,
there is a lack of connections into Zimbabwe's Chizarira and Matusadona NP and
the more distant Lower Zambezi and Mana Pools NPs. In some cases, one can also
detect imbalances between ingoing and outgoing links, hinting at potential
source-sink dynamics that occur due to asymmetries in landscape permeability
depending on the origin. For instance, while a large portion of dispersers from
the Chizaria NP in Zimbabwe manage to move into the Hwange NP, there are
comparably few dispersers that succeed in the opposite direction.

% The map shows all realized links by simulated dispersers between national parks
% and indicates the average duration a disperser had to move to realize those
% links. For instance, 6.8 \% of the simulated dispersers originating from the
% Moremi National Park successfully reached the Chobe National Park and 4.2 \% the
% Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. On average, dispersers moved for 623 steps
% before arriving at Chobe (SD = 520) and for 1'413 steps before arriving at
% Hwange (SD = 371). While the map only depicts connections between national
% parks, this does not imply that no connections to other protected areas exist
% and is the result of our simplifying assumptions above. Interestingly, while we
% identified a potential dispersal corridor between Angola's NPs and the Kafue NP
% in Zambia, \Cref{AreasReached} suggests that this link is only rarely realized
% and requires very long dispersal events. In contrast, we find that dispersal
% between the Moremi NP and Chobe NP are relatively frequent and require fewer
% steps, which can be expected given that the areas are located close to each
% other.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_AreasReached.png}
  \caption{Network on simulated dispersal trajectories highlighting connections
  between national parks (dark green). Yellow bubbles represent the center of
  the different national parks and are sized in relation to the number of

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Short Summary (90\%)}
% Maybe put this at the end?
We used ISSFs to analyse data of dispersing wild dogs and parametrize a fully
mechanistic movement model describing how dispersers move through the available
landscape. We employed the parametrized model as an individual-based movement
model and simulated 80'000 dispersing wild dogs moving 2'000 steps across the
extent of the KAZA-TFCA, the world's largest transboundary conservation area.
Based on simulated dispersal trajectories, we derived a set of three
complementary maps, all geared towards a better understanding of dispersal and
landscape connectivity. The set of maps included a heatmap, revealing frequently
traversed areas, a betweenness-map, delineating critical dispersal corridors and
bottlenecks, and a map of inter-patch connectivity, indicating the presence or
absence of functional links between national parks. We thereby showcase how
ISSFs can be utilized as simple, yet powerful framework to parametrize movement
models and simulate animal movement with the aim of assessing landscape
connectivity. Such an individual-based simulation overcomes several conceptual
shortcomings inherent to more traditional connectivity modeling techniques, such
as least-cost analyses and circuit theory. Nevertheless, we suggest to view
similar individual-based simulations as complement, and not as substitute, to
traditional connectivity models.

\subsection{Movement Model (80 \%)}
Our movement model of dispersing wild dogs comprised a habitat kernel, a
movement kernel, and their interactions. Together, the kernels described habitat
and movement preferences of dispersing individuals, as well as how movement
behavior was affected by habitat conditions. Parameter estimates from the
habitat kernel revealed that dispersing wild dogs avoid water, prefer its
proximity, avoid woodland, prefer shrubs/grassland, and avoid areas dominated by
humans. These findings are consistent with the findings of previous studies on
dispersing wild dogs \citep{DaviesMostert.2012, Masenga.2016, Woodroffe.2019,
Oneill.2020}, as well as with an earlier dispersal model that we developed
to investigate the habitat kernel of dispersers \citep{Hofmann.2021}.

By expanding our initial model to include a proper movement kernel, we were able
to model several additional complexities inherent to dispersal. It is, for
instance, well known that dispersers typically move with directional persistence
and that step lengths are correlated with turning angles. That is, larger steps
usually coincide with smaller turning angles and vice versa (cite someone).
While this correlation structure could be rendered by sampling turning angles
and step lengths from copula probability distributions \citep{Hodel.2021}, the
ISSF framework allowed us to model similar behavior directly in the movement
model. Besides accounting for directional persistence, we further exploited the
ISSF framework and included interactions between movement covariates to
represent the fact that wild dogs mainly move during the more temperate morning
and evening hours but tend to rest during the remainder of the day. The final
model thus rendered a pulse-like movement behavior, where dispersers realize
larger steps during morning and evening hours, but shorter steps during the rest
of the day.

By including interactions between habitat and movement covariates, we also
acknowledged that movement behavior of dispersers depends on habitat conditions.
For example, the final model contained an interaction between water cover and
step length, highlighting that dispersers are more likely to realize short steps
(i.e. move slower) in areas covered by water. Likewise, the interaction between
water cover and turning angles revealed that dispersers move less directional
when moving across water bodies. We believe that this behavior is owed to the
fact that wild dogs wade or swim to traverse waterbodies, thus resulting in
slower, more tortuous movements. Besides this, our model also suggested that
dipsersers preferably realize shorter steps when moving through woodland, but
larger steps when moving across shrubs/grassland. This can likely be attributed
to resting periods during which dispersers seek shade and protection below the
woodland canopy. Since we did not include three way interactions, we could not
test this hypothesis.

\subsection{Simulation (80\%)}
% I need to better distinguish our approach from other IBMMs, maybe use the term
% iSSF-IBMM?
Based on the above outlined model results, we simulated 80'000 dispersers moving
2'000 steps across the landscapes of the KAZA-TFCA. Our dispersal simulation
thus comprised 160 Mio. simulated steps, which required five days of computation
on a modern desktop machine. This rather long simulation duration was primarily
owed to the massive extent considered (including the buffer ca. 1.8 Mio. km
\textsuperscript{2}) and the large number of dispersers simulated. Most
connectivity studies consider much smaller extents (e.g.
\citealp{Kanagaraj.2013, Clark.2015, McClure.2016, Abrahms.2017, Zeller.2020})
and will therefore be able to attain faster simulation speeds. We also believe
that fewer simulated dispersers will often suffice, as the relative traversal
frequency of simulated individuals through randomly placed checkpoints in our
study area converged rather quickly (Appendices), yet this will vary depending
on the structure of the landscape and dispersal ability of the focal species.

A simulation-based approach as proposed in this article offers several striking
advantages over more traditional connectivity modeling techniques such as LCP
analysis or CT. In contrast to LCP analyses, for instance, an individual-based
simulation does not require to assume known endpoints, as endpoints emerge
naturally as the result of simulated dispersal trajectories. Liberating modelers
from the assumption of known endpoints is particularly important in dispersal
studies, as dispersers often venture into unfamiliar territory and are therefore
unlikely to know the destination of their journey. Additionally, without
pre-defined endpoints, movement corridors are no longer limited to certain
combinations of start- and endpoints, thereby permitting to detect movement
corridors that lead towards dead ends and insurmountable obstacles (i.e.
ecological traps).

IBMMs furthermore yield the advantage of an explicit representation of time.
This enables to answer questions such as: ``\textit{How long will it take a
disperser to move from A to B?}'' or \textit{Is it possible for a disperser to
move from A to B within X days?}, all undoubtedly interesting questions that
shift the focus from a structural to a more functional view on connectivity.
Similar questions cannot be answered using LCP methods or CT because the time
component is omitted from those models. An explicit representation of time in
IBMMs also yields opportunities for studying seasonal changes to connectivity
\cite{Zeller.2020}. With least-cost methods or circuit theory a dynamic analysis
of connectivity is impractical because the same analyses needs to be repeated
using different permeability surfaces (e.g. \citealp{Benz.2016, Osipova.2019}).
With IBMMs, on the other hand, simulated individuals can directly respond to a
dynamic environment within the model and the environment is allowed to change
``as the dispersers move''.

While an explicit representation of time yields several advantages, it also
requires that step lengths and turning angles are modeled properly
\citep{Kanagaraj.2013}, so that dispersal durations between habitat patches can
be reliably approximated. Accounting for and correctly rendering this movement
kernel is the main strength of ISSFs, which is why we believe that the framework
is particularly well suited for simulating animal dispersal and assessing
landscape connectivity. In principle, the ISSF framework allows to define an
infinite amount of movement kernels, each representing movement behavior under
different conditions \citep{Fieberg.2020}. It can therefore accommodate highly
diverse movement modes, including fast paced directional movements and slow
paced tortuous movements. Compared to models that disregard an animal's movement
kernel, this allows to model directional persistence, a movement characteristic
regularly observed in dispersing animals. To date, however, we only accounted
for 1. order autocorrelation. That is, we only considered correlations between
two subsequent steps. Modeling higher-order autocorrelation may be desirable,
yet will require more extensive data.

Overall, IBMMs enable a rich examination of the emergence of connectivity when
compared to the outputs of least-cost analysis or circuit theory. By generating
proper movement trajectories, a broad variety of summary statistics can be
derived. Specifically, by turning simulated trajectories into a network, network
theoretical metrics relevant to connectivity can be applied
\citep{BastilleRousseau.2018}. In contrast to least-cost path analysis and
circuit theory, a simulation-based approach permits studying inter-patch
connectivity. This facilitates the identification of asymmetrical links and
statements about source-sink dynamics \citep{Ferreras.2001, Revilla.2004,
Kanagaraj.2013}. Our results are also in concert with previous studies on
functional connectivity based on individual-based models that showed that
including the behavioral ecology of the target species and the landscape
structure are imperative when assessing connectivity \citep{Gustafson.1996,
Gardner.2004, Graf.2007, KramerSchadt.2004, Revilla.2004, Revilla.2008,
Kanagaraj.2013} rather than considering it purely a function of distance.

Besides the benefits of IBMMs, we also want to point out some caveats and not so
trivial modeling decisions. In particular, we will discuss five modeling
challenges: (1) number of simulated individuals, (2) location of source points,
(3) dispersal duration, (4) boundary behavior, and (5) individual variability.

(1) When simulating dispersal, the modeler needs to decide on the number of
simulated individuals. This decision involves the total (absolute) number of
simulated individuals across the study area, as well as the relative number of
simulated individuals per spatial entity (e.g. protected area, habitat patch,
source point). With regards to the total number of simulated individuals, a
larger number is usually desirable as it yields a more balanced view on
connectivity. However, this comes at the cost of computational efficiency,
implying that a trade-off needs to be managed. One simple solution to handle the
trade-off would be to simulate only as many individuals as are needed to achieve
convergence in the target metric. In our case, examination of the target metric
\textsf{traversal frequency} revealed that convergence was achieved with
relatively few individuals, such that additional dispersers contributed only
little additional information to our results. With regards to the relative
number of simulated individuals, we see two feasible approaches. First, one
could initiate dispersers in relation to population density at the respective
area. This would directly reflect the fact that population densities are not
homogeneous across space. (Say more) Alternatively, however, one could also
distribute dispersers homogeneously, but then weigh simulated trajectories by
the population density at the source patch (Say more). Because we lacked
reliable information on density estimates for the extent of the KAZA-TFCA, we
opted for a solution where dispersers were distributed homogeneously.

(2) While endpoints do not need to be defined in IBMMs, source points will still
need to be provided by the modeler. Here, we randomly placed source points
within protected areas large enough to sustain viable wild dog populations,
knowing that the species primarily survives in these formally protected areas
\citep{Woodroffe.1999, DaviesMostert.2012, Woodroffe.2012, VanDerMeer.2014}. In
some cases, exact locations of potential source populations are known and source
points can be placed accordingly \citep{Kanagaraj.2013}. Moreover, if abundance
estimates are available, these can be used to inform the relative number of
dispersers initiated at each location. In other cases, comparable knowledge may
be lacking and it could be more beneficial to delineate likely source patches
based on habitat suitability models (e.g. \citealp{Squires.2013}). Either way, a
meaningful selection of source points is not a problem unique to IBMMs and
applies to any connectivity modeling technique. As highlighted by
\cite{Signer.2017} the influence of the exact location of source points
decreases as the number of simulated steps is increased, yet their goal was
assessing steady state utilization distributions and not to assess landscape
connectivity.

(3) When employing IBMMs, one also needs to decide on meaningful dispersal
durations (number of simulated steps). We decided to simulate individuals for
2'000 steps, which is at the upper end of observed dispersal durations and may
have resulted in an overestimated representation of landscape connectivity.
Instead of enforcing homogeneous dispersal durations, one could also sample
dispersal durations from on observed dispersal events. Alternatively, after each
step, individuals could be faced with a probability to settle, where the
probability is contingent on the surrounding landscape and cumulative dispersal
distance traveled. Because we only observed few dispersal events and due to the
wild dog's ability to cover vast dispersal distance \citep{DaviesMostert.2012,
Masenga.2016, Cozzi.2020} we decided not to apply this approach. Regardless of
this, we think that in most cases it will be more insightful to simulate
relatively extensive dispersal events and only subsample afterwards.

(4) Unless simulated individuals are strongly drawn towards a point of
attraction, some simulated individuals will eventually approach a map boundary
and the modeler needs to define a rule to handle such situations. One feasible
option would be to terminate the trajectory as soon as it hits a map boundary,
implicitly assuming that the simulated animal left the study area and will not
return. The downside to this approach is that source points located near map
boundaries will inevitably produce many such dead ends. Alternatively, one could
remove transgressing random steps from the set of proposed random steps, thereby
forcing virtual dispersers to bounce off virtual boundaries and remain within
the main study area. This may seem like an elegant solution, yet again, it
potentially results in substantial edge effects when source points are located
near map boundaries. Finally, one could extend the study area by an artificial
buffer zone through which dispersers are allowed to leave and re-enter the main
study area. Of course this does not fully mitigate the issue, since some
dispersers may still approach the outer map boundary, however, as
\cite{Koen.2010} have shown, such an artificial buffer can often help to
mitigate edge effects. In theoretical applications, this issue can be
circumvented by simulating movement on a torus \citep{Hodel.2021b}, yet this is
unfeasible in most real world applications.

(5) We simulated dispersal using point estimates from our most parsimonious
movement model but did not investigate the sensitivity of our results with
respect to those estimates. Uncertainty is rather common in dispersal studies on
endangered species, as data tends to be scarce, resulting in model estimates
large confidence intervals \citep{Wiegand.2003, KramerSchadt.2007}. To address
this, one may explore a broader range of preferences instead of using point
estimates initiate dispersers with randomized preferences with variability
imposed by the uncertainty in the movement model. We therefore urge future
studies to investigate the sensitivity of ISSF simulations with respect to
estimated preferences.

\subsection{Maps (10\%)}
The heatmap resulting from our dispersal simulation suggests that a large
portion of dispersers traverses the Moremi NP and the Chobe NP in northern
Botswana. Since we already highlighted the same area in our previous analysis
\citep{Hofmann.2021}, this result was to be expected. Nevertheless, we believe
it reinforces our notion that the area acts as crucial hub inside the KAZA-TFCA.
The very same area stands out on the betweenness map, showing that the region is
not only frequently traversed, but actually serves as stepping stone into more
remote regions of the KAZA-TFCA. As such, the area exemplifies a region were
both traversal frequency and betweenness scores are high. In contrast, the
betweenness map suggests the presence of a corridor moving from Angola into
Zambia's Kafue NP, yet when looking at the heatmap, one realizes that the area
is not used very often. Consequently, despite the corridor's importance for
linking Angola's NPs to Zambia's Np, only very few simulated dispersers
successfully traversed it. This is also reflected in the inter-patch
connectivity map, where the Kafue NP only receives very few links from the
central region of the KAZA-TFCA.

Each map that we produced from simulated trajectories accentuates a different
aspect of connectivity. The heatmap, for example, puts emphasis on areas where
movement is concentrated, regardless whether such areas represent ``dead ends''
that do not necessarily connect distinct patches. Therefore, the heatmap is
useful to determine locations where a disperser are likely to move to, yet not
necessarily to uncover corridors that link valuable habitats. The betweenness
map, on the other hand, brings out those areas that are relevant in connecting
different regions in the landscape. In this regard, the betweenness map is most
pertinent to the delineation of dispersal corridors and may serve as an
alternative to least-cost algorithms. Finally, the inter-patch connectivity map
illustrates the frequency at which dispersal between distinct habitat patches
occurs, as well as the average dispersal duration that passes when individuals
move between those patches. This knowledge serves to gauge the amount of
gene flow between habitat patches and can be employed to determine whether two
habitats are connected or not.

\subsection{General (20\%)}
% Mortality during dispersal
While we did not attempt to model mortality during dispersal, it is
well known that dispersers regularly die, mainly due to deadly encounters with
predators, road kills, or persecution by humans \citep{Woodroffe.2012,
Behr.2021b}. Mortality during dispersal could therefore substantially limit
functional connectivity, especially in areas where the likelihood of
encountering competitors and humans is high \citep{Cozzi.2020}. If corresponding
information is available, IBMMs would readily allow to model mortality. Each
timestep, a binary draw determines whether the animal survives or not and this
probability can depend on landscape characteristics as well as the dispersal
duration.

% Other studies that use similar simulations
Our approach of simulating movement to assess connectivity is most closely
related to the works of \cite{Clark.2015} and \cite{Zeller.2020}, who used
regular step selection functions to model habitat preferences by black bears and
simulated movement to assess connectivity. However, neither of these studies
attempted to jointly model habitat and movement kernels, thereby precluding a
more mechanistic understanding of movement. Moreover, both studies parametrized
models using data of resident black bears, which may lead to a biased view on
connectivity, as dispersers may move substantially further, thereby improving
connectivity among habitat patches \citep{Elliot.2014}.

% Spatially Realistic Population Models
Besides enabling a more mechanistic understanding of connectivity, the ability
to realistically render movement during dispersal also forms the foundation for
spatially realistic population models. In these models, dispersal is not merely
represented by a dispersal kernel (e.g. ...) but mechanistically rendered
\citep{Revilla.2008}. Such population models can ultimately be employed to
determine the required level of dispersal to achieve metapopulation viability
\citep{DaviesMostert.2012}.

% Simulations for an early warning system?
Simulations resulting from IBMMs could furthermore be utilized as simple tool to
predict the likely whereabouts of GPS collared animals into the near future. In
some European countries, the comeback of large predators, such as bears, lynx,
and the wolf, has triggered emotional discussions and raised public concern
\citep{Behr.2017}, particularly in areas with free-roaming livestock that may be
prayed upon by the returned species. An early warning system based on
simulations could thus serve to forewarn about potential encounters and and
thereby increase public acceptance of large predators.

% Social landscape
We have previously attributed the weak significance of distance to water to the
fact that we did not control for the presence or absence of conspecifics. We
stick to this reasoning as our expanded model still shows a rather large
uncertainty around the respective beta coefficients. To better gauge the
importance and influence of this covariate, future studies will need to control
for inter- and intra-specific interactions that may explain why and when
dispersers are attracted to or afraid of waterbodies. \cite{Fortin.2005}, for
instance, found that elk movement was significantly impacted by the density of
wolf in the area, such that habitat preferences strictly differed depending on
the presence or absence of wolves. The decision to settle is likely related to
the presence or absence of conspecifics. Hence, the exact dispersal duration and
distance will not be independent of current wild dog densities. In dispersing
wolves, for instance, the longest dispersal distances have been observed in
low-density populations \citep{Boyd.2005, Wabakken.2007}. The dispersal duration
may thus be determined by the by the amount of isolation between subpopulations
and population densities \citep{DaviesMostert.2012}.

% We did not validate all of our predictions
Even though our simulations generated several interesting results, most of them
need to be validated using independent data. We learned that between some
national parks asymmetries between the number of ingoing and outgoing dispersers
exist, suggesting that some patches act as sinks, whereas others serve as
sources for dispersers.

% Downsides of connectivity?
Even though connectivity is generally thought to promote population viability,
it is also related to various aspects that may cause ecological damage, such as
increased human-wildlife conflicts or facilitated spread of deadly diseases.

% Conclusion
To this end, we have exemplified the use of ISSFs as a simple framework based on
which researchers can parametrize dispersers' habitat and movement preferences
and at the same time use the parametrized model to as an individual-based
movement model to simulate dispersal and examine landscape connectivity.
Furthermore, we suggest to analyse simulated trajectories using three
complementary maps, each focused on a different aspect of connectivity.
Ultimately, we hope to have sparked interest in the uprising framework of step
selection functions for investigating dispersal behavior and landscape
connectivity. Nevertheless, we do not attempt to dismiss the application of
traditional connectivity models such as least-cost methods or circuit theory by
any means. Rather, we propose to use simulations from ISSF-IBMMs as a simple but
powerful tool that complements earlier methods in an attempt provide a more
comprehensive understanding of landscape connectivity.
