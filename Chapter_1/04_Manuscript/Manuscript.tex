\begin{abstract}
For many species, dispersal represents a crucial process that allows to avoid
inbreeding, to colonize new habitats and to reinforce small and unviable
subpopulations. Successful dispersal is therefore a crucial pre-requisite for
long-term species persistence in wild animal populations. However, the ability
to disperse is contingent a sufficient degree of landscape connectivity, which
is why the estimation of connectivity and identification of dispersal corridors
has become a task of extraordinary importance in ecological studies and for the
planning of conservation initiatives.

Over the past two decades, scientists have mainly relied on analytical tools
such as least-cost methods and circuit theory to investigate landscape
connectivity. This is largely owed to their ease of use and intuitive nature,
which have facilitated their application in the past. Despite their usefulness
for various ecological applications, both methods make several restricting
assumptions that can limit their applicability in reality. Least-cost analysis,
for instance, suffers from the fact that animals are assumed to have perfect
knowledge about the entire landscape and choose cost-minimizing routes
accordingly. On the contrary, circuit theory assumes that animals walk according
to a complete random walk, which is equally unlikely to hold in reality.

Fortunately, recent innovations in movement ecology have brought forward novel
opportunities to study dispersal and landscape connectivity. In particular, the
rich suite of resource selection functions has undergone substantial
improvements in recent years. Most notably, step selection functions have been
generalized to \textit{integrated} step selection functions, which essentially
represent fully mechanistic movement models based on which individual animal
movement could be predicted and simulated. While such models have been applied
to simualte the steady state utilization distribution, similar approaches could
be useful for investigating transient movement behavior and study landscape
connectivity in a much more natural way.

Here, we showcase the use of integrated step selection analysis to simulate
dispersal of a top-predator across a large study area. For this, we collected
data on 16 dispersing wild dogs and analysed it in an integrated step selection
analysis to produce a fully mechanistic movement model rendering wild dog
dispersal. Based on this model, we simulated 80'000 dispersers moving across the
Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, the world's largest
transboundary conservation area. We summarize the simulation output in a heatmap
indicating the intensity of use across the KAZA-TFCA, and we apply network
theory to produce a set of complementary maps that further reveal major
dispersal hotspots and crucial bottlenecks. Finally, we discuss the benefits and
pitfalls of dispersal simualtions and we highlight improvements to be made in
the future.

\section{Introduction}
% Importance of Dispersal & Connectivity
Dispersal of individuals is an important process governing the dynamics wild
animal populations that are distributed in space \citep{Clobert.2012}. It is
defined as the movement of individuals from their natal location to the site of
first reproduction \cite{Howard.1960} and allows species to avoid inbreeding
\citep{Perrin.1999, Perrin.2000, Frankham.2002, Leigh.2012}, to rescue small and
unviable populations \citep{Brown.1977}, and to promote the colonization of
unoccupied habitats \citep{Hanski.1998, MacArthur.2001}. Successfull dispersal
requires a sufficient degree of landscape connectivity, which is why the
protection of dispersal corridors has become a major goal in conservation
science. Information on movement behavior during dispersal and knowledge about
the factors that limit dispersal is therefore critical for a comprehensive
understanding of landscape connectivity and population viability
\citep{Baguette.2013, Vasudev.2015}. In addition, reliable modelling techniques
to identify dispersal corridors based on empirical data are necessary
\citep{Diniz.2019}.

% Advancements in GPS Technology and Movement Ecology
Thanks to novel technologies developed over the past decades, particularly of
GPS/Satellite radio-collars, the study of dispersal and connectivity using
telemetry data has accelerated \citep{Jonsson.2016, Williams.2019}.
Additionally, the advent of publicly accessible satellite imagery and
sophisticated remote sensing techniques to represent the physical landscape
through which individuals disperse have heralded the ``golden age of animal
tracking'' \citep{Kays.2015}. Concurrently, the increased availability of large
amounts of empirical data and an increased computational power have led to the
development of several modelling techniques that allow studying movement
behavior during dispersal and highlighting major movement corridors
\citep{Boyce.2002, Fortin.2005, Cushman.2010, Zeller.2012, Diniz.2019}.

% Resource Selection & Connectivity
\textit{Resource selection functions} \citep{Boyce.2002} and derived methods
such as \textit{step selection functions} \citep{Fortin.2005} and \textit{path
selection functions} \citep{Cushman.2010} have proven particularly useful for
studying animal movement \citep{Fieberg.2020}. These methods allow estimating
habitat preferences of the focal species by comparing covariates at locations
visited by the animal to the scame covariates at locations available to, but not
visited by the animal. The so estimated preferences can then be used to predict
a permeability surface, indicating the expected ease at which an animal can
traverse a given area \citep{Zeller.2012}. Utimately, the permeability surface
serves as input to a connectivity model that is used to reveal movement
corridors. In this regard, two of the most prominent connectivity models in the
literature are least-cost path analysis \citep{Adriaensen.2003} and circuit
theory \citep{McRae.2006, McRae.2008}.

% Least-cost path
In least-cost path analysis, connectivity is estimated by identifying
least-costly routes between pre-defined start- and endpoints
\citep{Adriaensen.2003}. For this, the permeability surface is converted into a
network graph and permeability scores are translated into probabilities for
moving from one cell to another. Least-costly routes between start- and
endpoints can then be computed using Dijkstra’s algorithm \citep{Dijkstra.1959}.
Although intuitively appealing, the method suffers from several weaknesses.
First of all, a least-cost path always exist, even if the associated costs are
unreasonably high. Second, it assumes that animals have a preconceived end-point
in mind and choose a cost-minimizing route accordingly. While this assumption
may be reasonable for migrating animals that move between a limited number of
habitats, it is unlikely to hold for dispersers that move over long distances
into unknown territory \citep{Koen.2014, Abrahms.2017, Cozzi.2020}. Finally, the
method also requires that animals have an infinite perceptual range, otherwise
they could not compute an optimal path. Some of these issues have been addressed
using alternative least-cost approaches. For instance, instead of computing a
least-cost path, a least cost-corridor that also considers slightly suboptimal
routes \citep{Pinto.2009} can be calculated. The corridor relaxes the assumption
of perfect knowledge and overcomes the single pixel width issue. Alternatively,
the randomized least-cost path has been proposed, which allows animals to
deviate from the least-cost route by a pre-defined factor \(\theta\)
\citep{Panzacchi.2016, VanMoorter.2021}.

% Circuit theory
In contrast to least-cost approaches, circuit theory makes use of electrical
circuit theory to quantify landscape connectivity \citep{McRae.2006,
McRae.2008}. Here, the permeability surface is converted into an electrical
circuit containing nodes and resistor, where resistance values depend on habitat
permeability. A source point is connected to a current source, whereas an
endpoint is grounded. Hence, the current flowing through each node in the
circuit can be computed and is supposed to resemble the relative frequency at
which each location in the study area is being visited. By revealing not only a
single path or corridor, circuit theory overcomes the single-pixel width issue
inherent to least-cost approaches. Intrinsically, circuit theory is based on the
assumption that animals follow a random walk and can therefore not render
directional biases. In reality, however, dispersers often move in a very
directional fashion as they want to cover as much ground in as little time as
possible. Furthermore, it is assumed that individuals have a perceptual range of
a single pixel, which rarely captures the true spatial scale of selection (cite
someone).

% Temporal scale
Neither least-cost analyes or circuit theory are capable of rendering the
temporal dimension of movement. Such influences could, however, be studied using
individual based movement models. Still, only few have explored these
possibilities \citep{Kanagaraj.2013, Hauenstein.2019, Zeller.2020}.

% Step selection analysis
While step selection functions were initially intended to learn about habitat
preferences of the focal species \citep{Fortin.2005}, recent improvements may
elevate its applicability into other areas. Originally, \cite{Fortin.2005}
proposed step selection functions to account for serial autocorrelation inherent
to GPS relocation data. In this method, covariates along realized steps (the
connecting lines between two consecutive relocations; ; \citealp{Turchin.1998})
are contrasted to covariates along  ``alternative''  or  ``random steps'' that
are generated by randomly sampling turning angles and step lengths based on
observed movement characteristics. It is then assumed that animals assign a
selection score \(w(x)\) of the following form to each step:

\begin{equation}
\label{EQ1}
  w(x) = exp(\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n)
\end{equation}

The selection score \(w(x)\) of each step depends on its associated covariates
(\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)) and on the animal's relative selection strengths (i.e.
preferences) towards these covariates (\(\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n\)). The
probability that a step \(i\) is realized \(P(Y_{i} = 1\)) then depends on the
step's selection score, as well as on the selection scores of all alternative
steps:

\begin{equation}
\label{EQ2}
  P(Y_{i} = 1 | Y_{1} + Y_{2} + ... + Y_{i} = 1) =
  \frac{w(x_{i})}{w(x_{1}) + w(x_{2}) + ... + w(x_{i})}
\end{equation}

\noindent Preferences of interest, i.e. the \(\beta\)'s, can be estimated by
comparing realized (scored 1) and random (scored 0) steps in a conditional
logistic regression model \citep{Fortin.2005}. In this model, positive
\(\beta\)-coefficients indicate selection of a covariate, whereas negative
\(\beta\)-coefficients indicate avoidance of a covariate. To deal with multiple
individuals, one can either average estimates of individual models
\citep{Murtaugh.2007, Fieberg.2010} or apply mixed effects conditional logistic
regression analysis as recently proposed by \cite{Muff.2020}.

% Integrated step selection analysis
An animals movement trajectory can be viewed as the result of an interplay
between habitat and movement preferences. Traditional step selection functions
cannot account for a correlation between turning angles and step lengths, unless
the two are sampled jointly from a copula distribution \citep{Hodel.2021}.
Recently, however, SSFs have been generalized to \textit{integrated} SSFs
(iSSFs), which tear apart movement and habitat preferences of the studied
animals \citep{Avgar.2016}. The method thus allows to render an animals
preferences with respect to prevailing habitat conditions, as well as with
respect to movement characteristics. This reduces potential biases in estimated
preferences and enables parametrization of a fully mechanistic movement model
from which movement and space use can be simulated \citep{Avgar.2016,
Signer.2017}. \cite{Signer.2017} used integrated step selection analysis to
simulate steady state utilization distributions of resident animals. However,
the degree to which such simulations could be used to simulate dispersers and
infer movement corridors is unknown.

% Study Species & Study Area
One of the species for which long-term species persistence relies on sufficient
landscape connectivity is the endangered African wild dog \textit{Lycon pictus}.
This species has once been wide-spread across sub-Saharan Africa but disappeared
from a vast majority of its historic range due to ongoing persecution by humans,
habitat destruction, and deadly diseases. As of today, only 6'000 free-ranging
individuals remain in small and spatially scattered subpopulations. Within those
subpopulations, wild dogs form cohesive packs comprising 8 to 12 adults and
their offspring \cite{McNutt.1995}. After reaching sexual maturity, male and
female offspring form same-sex coalitions and disperse from their natal pack
\citep{McNutt.1996, Behr.2020}. New packs are formed when dispersing coalitions
join unrelated opposite-sex dispersing coalitions \citep{McNutt.1996}.
Dispersing wild dogs can cover several hundred kilometers across a variety of
landscapes \citep{DaviesMostert.2012, Masenga.2016, Cozzi.2020, Hofmann.2021}.
One of the few strongholds for this species lies near the Moremi Game Reserve in
northern Botswana, which is part of the world's largest transboundary protected
area, namely the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA-TFCA).
This area has originally been intended to facilitate migration of elephants, but
is expected to benefit a multitude of other species \citep{Elliot.2014,
Brennan.2020, Hofmann.2021}.

In a previous paper, we assessed landscape connectivity within the KAZA-TFCA for
dispersing African wild dogs using a least-cost corridor approach. For this, we
fitted a basic habitat selection model based on which we predicted landscape
permeability. We now expand on this knowledge and develop a more detailed
movement model of dispersing wild dogs. We then use this model to simulate
thousands of dispersers moving across the KAZA-TFCA. Based on said simulations,
we compute heatmaps and identify potential dispersal hotspots and compare them
to the dispersal routes identified in \citep{Hofmann.2021}. We also showcase how
simulated dispersal data can be analysed using network-analysis and how network
metrics relevant to landscape connectivity can be computed. Our results show
that a simulation based approach yields several major benefits over traditional
connectivity modelling techniques. Most importantly, simulations provide a more
generic view on how connectivity emerges and to which degree connectivity
depends on the dispersal duration. In addtion, by generating proper dispersal
trajectories, network theory can be applied to calculate network metrics that
are pertinent to connectivity analysis. Finally, we put forward additional
opportunities using simulations that go beyond the scope of this paper.

Reliable identification of dispersal corridors will become increasingly
important with the uprise of ever-growing and often transboundary conservation
areas. One such instance is the KAZA-TFCA, a massive conservation area spanning
five countries and over 520'000 km\textsuperscript{2}. The KAZA holds the
potential of re-establishing dispersal routes for many of its protected species,
including the african wild dog \textit{Lycaon pictus}.  Persecution by humans,
habitat loss, and reduced connectivity are major causes of the decline of the
species \citep{Woodroffe.2012}. In result, the species currently marks the
KAZA's most endangered large carnivore and has been a assigned a very high
conservation priority. Importantly, due to their inherent mobility and intrinsic
need for vast undisturbed landscapes, AWDs have been proposed as surrogate
species for landscape connectivity (see recent paper on multispecies
connectivity). Nevertheless, the species has received little attention in the
connectivity literature, mainly due to the difficulty in observing wild dog
dispersal.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Study Area}
The study area was centered at -17\degree 13'9''S, 23\degree 56'4''E
(\Cref{StudyArea}a) and was represented by a rectangular bounding box that
stretched over 1.3 Mio. km\textsuperscript{2}, ecompassing the entire KAZA-TFCA
(\Cref{StudyArea}b). The KAZA-TFCA is the world's largest transboundary
conservation area and comprises parts of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe,
and Zambia, covering a total of 520'000 km\textsuperscript{2}. Its landscape
varies regionally and ranges from savanna, to grassland and from dry to moist
woodland habitats. A dominant hydrogeographical feature in its center is the
flood-pulsing Okavango Delta. The delta and its surroundings are considered a
stronghold for African wild dogs that may act as a source for the recolonization
of surrounding habitats \citep{Cozzi.2013}. The wet season within the KAZA-TFCA
lasts from November to March and is out of phase with the main flooding of the
Okavango Delta which peaks between July and August \citep{McNutt.1996,
Wolski.2017}. While large portions of land within the KAZA-TFCA are designated
national parks or other protected areas, substantial human influence remains due
to roads, agricultural sites and settlements and villages.

    Botswana.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{GPS Relocation Data}
Between 2011 and 2019, we collected GPS relocation data on dispersing wild dogs
from a free-ranging wild dog population inhabiting the Moremi National Park in
northern Botswana. We selected potential dispersers based on age, pack size,
number of same‐sex siblings within the pack, and presence of unrelated
opposite-sex individuals in the pack \citep{McNutt.1996, Behr.2020}. We
immobilized selected individuals using a cocktail of Ketamine/Xylazine/Atropine
\citep{Osofsky.1996, Cozzi.2020} that was injected by dart, fired from a
CO\textsubscript{2}-pressurized gun (\textit{DAN-Inject, Denmark}). Anesthesia
protocols were approved by the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources
Conservation and Tourism of Botswana (permit EWT 8/36/4 XXXVI). Immobilized
individuals were fitted with GPS/Satellite radio collars (\textit{Vertex Lite;
Vectronic Aerospace GmbH, Berlin}) that guaranteed automated drop-off through a
decomposable piece of cotton. Handling and collaring of all individuals was
supervised by a Botswana-registered wildlife veterinarian and all individuals
rejoined their pack within one hour after immobilization. 16 collared
individuals eventually dispersed, each in a separate same-sex coalition (7
female and 9 male coalitions).

During dispersal, collars were programmed to record a GPS fix every 4 hours.
Collected relocations were regularly transmitted over the Iridium satellite
system, which allowed remote tracking of individuals, even if they left the main
study area and crossed international borders. In some instances exact dispersal
dates were known from field observations. In other cases, we distinguished
between residency and dispersal using the net-squared displacement metric. This
metric measures the squared Euclidean distance a GPS relocation to a reference
point \citep{Borger.2012}, which in our case was set to the center of each
individual's natal home range. As such, dispersal was deemed to have started
when an individual left its natal home range and ended once individuals became
sedentary again. Because behavior during dispersal is more pertinent for
assessing connectivity, we discarded all data that was collected during
residency and only retained GPS data recorded during dispersal. As previous
research revealed similar behavior of females and males during dispersal
\citep{Woodroffe.2019, Cozzi.2020}, we did not distinguish between sexes. After
collection, we converted collected GPS coordinates (n = 4'169) to steps, where
each step represented the straight-line distance traveled by and individual
between two consecutive GPS relocations \citep{Turchin.1998}. To ensure a
regular sampling interval, we removed fixes that were not collected on the
4-hourly schedule.

\subsection{Covariates}
We represented the physical landscape across the study area using a set of
habitat covariates including water-cover, distance to water, tree-cover, and
shrub/grassland-cover. Because water cover greatly changes within and between
years around the Okavango Delta, we applied a remote sensing technique that
allowed us to generate frequently updated water cover layers and corresponding
distance to water layers for the close surroundings of the Delta (see
\citealp{Wolski.2017} and \citealp{Hofmann.2021}). Thus, those layers temporally
aligned with our dispersal events. We also computed a proxy for human influence,
depicting anthropogenic pressures stemming from human-density, agricultural
sites, and roads. All obtained layers were coarsened or interpolated to a target
resolution of 250 m by 250 m and cropped slightly beyond the extent of the
KAZA-TFCA. Further details on the sources and preparation of each habitat
covariate are given in \cite{Hofmann.2021}.

Besides habitat covariates, we also computed movement metrics that we used as
movement covariates in our models. Movement metrics were calculated for each
step and included the step length (\textsf{sl}), its natural logarithm
(\textsf{log(sl)}), and the cosine of the relative turning angle
(\textsf{cos(ta)}). Because wild dogs follow a diurnal activity pattern, we also
coded a binary variable (\textsf{LowActivity}) indicating whether a step was
realized during periods of low wild dog activity (17:00 to 07:00 local time) or
high wild dogactivity (09:00 to 17:00 local time). Handling and manipulation of
all data, as well as all modelling and simulating was achieved with statistical
software {\tt R}, version 3.6.6 \citep{R.2019}. {\tt R}-scripts to reproduce the
analyses are provided on Github.

\subsection{Movement Model}
We used integrated step selection functions (iSSF) to parametrize a mechanistic
movement model of dispersing wild dogs. In contrast to regular step selection
functions, \textit{integrated} step selection functions allow simultaneous
inference on movement and habitat preferences of the studied animal, as well as
on potential interactions between the two. This results in less biased selection
estimates and allows to treat the resulting model as a fully mechanistic
movement model based on which movement can be simulated \citep{Avgar.2016}. To
conduct iSSF analysis, we paired each observed step with 24 random steps.
Together, an observed and its random steps formed a stratum that received a
unique identifier. The 24 random steps served as pseudeo-absence and represented
a potential alternative that the animal could have realized but decided not to.
We generated random steps by sampling random turning angles from a uniform
distribution (\(-\pi, +\pi\)) and step lengths from a gamma distirbution that
was fitted to observed steps (scale = 6'308, shape = 0.37). Although a larger
number of random steps reduces the sampling error \citep{Avgar.2016},
preliminary analyses revealed that 24 steps were sufficient in our case. Along
each step, we extracted and averaged spatial covariates using the {\tt velox}
package and we calculated the movement metrics \textsf{sl}, \textsf{log(sl)},
and \textsf{cos(ta)}. To facilitate model convergence, we standardized all
continuous covariates to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Since
correlation among covariates was low (\(|r| > 0.6\); \citealp{Latham.2011}), we
retained all of them for modeling.

To contrast realized steps (scored 1) and random steps (scored 2) and fit a
movement model, we assumed that animals assigned a selection score \(w(x)\) to
each step. The score depended on the step's covariates \(X\), as well as the
animals preferences \(\beta\) towards these covariates. The probability of a
step being realized was then contingent on the step's selection score, as well
as on the selection scores of all other step in the same stratum. To estimate
the preferences of interest, we ran conditional logistic regression models in
the r-package {\tt glmmTMB}. More specifically, we applied the method developed
by \citep{Muff.2020}, which allows to fit random slopes. Here, we treated animal
IDs as random effect and modelled random slopes for each covariate and we fixed
the random intercept variance at an arbitrary high value of
10\textsuperscript{6} to make use of the  ``poission''-trick  \citep{Muff.2020}.

The movement model was based on a habitat selection model for dispersing wild
dogs presented in \cite{Hofmann.2021}. In the original model, no interactions
between the habitat and movement covariates were considered, so we slightly
expanded this base model by proposing interactions between movement and habitat
covariates. More specifically, we started with the base model and incrementally
increased model complexity by adding all possible two-way interactions between
habitat covariates and movement covariates. For instance, for the covariate
\textsf{water}, we proposed the interactions \textsf{Water:log(sl)},
\textsf{Water:log(sl)}, and \textsf{Water:cos(ta)}. Besides those combinations,
we also proposed the interactions \textsf{sl:cos(ta)} and
\textsf{log(sl):cos(ta)} to account for a correlation between turning angles and
step lengths, as well as the interactions \textsf{sl:LowActivity} and
\textsf{log(sl):LowActivity} to account for the fact that step lengths may
differ due to wild dogs' diurnal activity pattern. To compare competing models
and assess the most parsimonious movement model, we ran stepwise forward model
selection based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC, \citealp{Burnham.2002}).

We validated the predictive power of the most parsimonious movement model using
k-fold cross-validation for case-control studies as presented
\cite{Fortin.2009}. We randomly split the input data into training and testing
data with an 80:20 ratio. Using the training data we parametrized a movement
model based on which we predicted selection scores \(w(x)\) for all steps in the
test data. Within each stratum we then assigned ranks 1-25 to each step based on
predicted selection scores such that rank 1 was given to the step with the
highest score \(w(x)\). Across all strata we determined the realized step's rank
and calculated rank frequencies for realized steps. Finally, we computed
Spearman's rank correlation between ranks and associated frequencies \(r_{s,
realized}\). We replicated the entire procedure 100 times and computed the mean
correlation coefficient (\(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\)), as well as its 95\%
confidence interval across all replicates. For comparison, we repeated the same
procedure 100 times assuming random preferences. Random preferences were
implemented by discarding the realized step from all strata and identifying the
rank of a random step in each stratum. Again, we calculated Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient (\(r_{s, random}\)), its mean across repetitions
(\(\bar{r}_{s, random}\)), and its 95\% confidence interval. This validation
proofs a significant prediction in case the confidence intervals of
\(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\) and \(\bar{r}_{s, random}\) do not overlap.

\subsection{Dispersal Simulation}
We used the most parsimonious movement model to simulate 80'000 dispersing wild
dogs moving across the KAZA-TFCA. The simulation resembled an inverted iSSF and
worked as follows. (1) We defined a random source point and assumed a random
initial orientation of the animal. (2) Departing from the source point, we
generated 25 random steps by sampling relative turning angles from a uniform
distribution (\(-\pi, +\pi\)) and step lengths from our fitted gamma
distribution. As such, each step corresponded to the straight line movement
conducted within 4 hours. To prevent unreasonably large steps, we capped sampled
values to a maximum of 35 km, which corresponds to the farthest distance ever
traveled within 4 hours by on of our dispersers. (3) Along each random step, we
extracted and averaged habitat covariates and calculated movement covariates.
Extracted values were again standardized using the same transformations that
were used on the input data. (4) We applied the parameterized movement model and
predicted the selection score \(w(x)\) for each of the proposed steps and
translated selection scores into probabilities by applying \Cref{EQ2}. (5) We
randomly sampled one of the random steps based on predicted probabilities and
used it to determine the animal's new position. We repeated steps (2) to (5)
until a total of 2'000 steps were realized.

To minimize the influence of edge effects and to deal with random steps leaving
the study area, we followed \citep{Koen.2010} and artificially expanded all
covariate layers by adding a 100 km buffer zone. Within the buffer zone, we
randomized covariate values by resampling values from the original covariate
layers. In result, simulated dispersers were able to leave and reenter the main
study area through this buffer zone. In cases where a disperser approached the
outer map boundary such that one of the proposed random steps transgressed its
border, we resampled transgressing steps until they fully lied within the buffer
zone. Although the algorithm for the simulation was mainly coded in {\tt R}, we
wrote a few helper functions in {\tt C++} and imported them into {\tt R} using
the {\tt Rcpp} package \citep{Eddelbuettel.2011, Eddelbuettel.2013}.

\subsection{Source Points}
We initiated virtual dispersers at 50'000 randomly selected source points within
contiguous protected areas larger \(>\) 700 km\textsuperscript{2}
(\Cref{SourcePoints} (a)). This conforms to the average home range requirement
of resident wild dogs \citep{Pomilia.2015} and allowed us to remove areas too
small to host viable wild dog populations. By distributing source points
randomly, the number of source points per km\textsuperscript{2} within protected
areas was approximately equal across the study area. To render potential
immigrants into the study system, we placed additional 30'000 source points
inside the buffer zone around the main study area (\Cref{SourcePoints} (b)).
This resulted in a total of 80'000 source points, each representing the start
point of an individual disperser.

    \caption{(a) Different source areas from which we released virtual
    dispersers. We only considered contiguous protected areas (national parks,
    game reserves, and forest reserves) that were larger than 700
    km\textsuperscript{2} (green). This area corresponds to the average home
    range requirement for viable wild dog populations \citep{Pomilia.2015}. To
    render potential immigrants into the study system, we also initiated
    dispersers within a buffer zone (blue) surrounding the main study area. (b)

    \label{SourcePoints}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Heatmap}
To identify dispersal hotspots across our study area using the simulated
dispersal events, we rasterized all simulated trajectories and created a heatmap
indicating the absolute frequency at which each raster-cell in the study area
was visited by our virtual dispersers. If the same trajectory crossed a
raster-cell twice, it was only counted once, meaning that we did not consider
revisits. This mitigated biases arising due to trapped individuals that were
moving in circles. To achieve high performance rasterization of all simulated
trajectories, we used the R-package {\tt terra} \citep{Hijmans.2020}.

\subsection{Network Analysis I: Betweenness}
To pinpoint areas of exceptional relevance for connecting remote regions in our
study area, we converted simulated trajectories into a network and calculated
betweenness scores. More specifically, we overlaid the study area (including the
buffer) with a regular raster that was resolved at 5 x 5 km and where each
raster-cell represented a node in the final network. We then used the simulated
trajectories to determine all transitions occurring from one cell to another, as
well as their frequency. This resulted in an edge-list that we translated into a
weighted network using the r-package {\tt igraph}. Because {\tt igraph} handles
the weights \(\omega\) as costs, we inverted the traversal frequency at each
cell by applying \(\omega = \frac{\sum_i^n{Traversal Frequency_i}/n}{Traversal
Frequency_i}\). Finally, we calculated the betweenness metric for each node in
the final network. This metric indicates how often a specific raster-cell lies
on a shortest path between two other raster-cells and is therefore a useful
metric to detect movement corridors \citep{BastilleRousseau.2018}.

\subsection{Network Analysis II: Interpatch-Connectivity}
We also adopted an alternative network view and assessed interpatch connectivity
between national parks. The decision to focus on national parks was purely out
of simplicity and could easily be expanded to any other patch of interest. To
determine interpatch-connectivity, we identified the relative frequency at which
dispersers originating from one national park successfully moved into an other
national park. This allowed us to determine \textit{if} and \textit{how often}
dispersers moved between certain national parks, as well as to estimate the
average number of steps that was necessary for those movements.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Movement Model}
Compared to the base model reported in \citep{Hofmann.2021}, our most
parsimonious movement model included several additional interactions between
habitat and movement covariates (\Cref{MovementModel} and
\Cref{MovementModelNumbers}). Although multiple models received an AIC weight
above zero (T1 in Appendix S1), we only consiered results from the  ``best''
model for further analyses. Since all models with positive AIC weight contained
similar covariates, this decision only marginally influenced subsequent results.
Results from the selected model are given in \Cref{MovementModelNumbers} and
illustrated in \Cref{MovementModel} (a). Additional plots to ease with the
interpretation of the model are provided in Appendix XX.

When holding constant for movement behavior, we find that dispersing wild dogs
avoid water, but prefer its proximity. Dispersers also avoid densely forested
woodlands, yet prefer open shrublands or grasslands. Finally, dispersers avoid
moving through landscapes that are influenced by humans.

When looking at the movement kernel, we observe several significant
interactions. However, except for the interaction \textsf{sl:LowActivity},
estimated slopes are relatively flat, suggesting that our initial distributions
for step lengths and turning angles were only marginally biased. For instance,
the positive effect for \textsf{cos(ta)} indicates that observed turning angles
are slightly more directional compared to the turning angles proposed by our
uniform distribution. On the other hand, the strongly significant and negative
interaction \textsf{sl:LowActivity} reveals that our fitted gamma distribution
produced steps lengths that were substantially larger that those realized by the
dispersers during low wild dog activity.

However, we also find a strongly significant and negative interaction between
the step length and main-activity indicator, showing that realized step lengths
tended to be much shorter during periods of activity in comparison to the steps
proposed by our fitted gamma distribution.

Finally, the significant interactions \textsf{cos(ta):HumanInfluence} and
\textsf{cos(ta):DistanceToWater\textsuperscript{2}} indicate that dispersers
move much more tortuous in areas influenced by humans but more directed when
distant to water.

Results from the k-fold cross-validation procedure show that our model
substantially outperforms a random guess, as the confidence intervals of r.. and
r.. do not overlap. Additionally, we find that the rank correlation slightly
improved in comparison to the base model reported in \citep{Hofmann.2021}.

\subsection{Dispersal Simulation}
On a machine with an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X processor with 8 x 3.6 GHz and 64 GB of
RAM, a single batch of 1'000 simulated dispersers took roughly 90 minutes to
compute (\(\mu = 88.90\), \(\sigma = 1.87\)). As such, the simulation of all
80'000 dispersers terminated after 120 hours, i.e. five days. However,
comparable computations will be substantially quicker for smaller study areas,
as the covariate extraction from large rasters was computationally the most
expensive task.

On average, step lengths realized by the simulated dispersers (\(\mu = 2'093\)
m, \(\sigma = 3'067\)) were slightly shorter than those by observed dispersers
(\(\mu = 2'326\) m, \(\sigma = 3'323\)). Simultaneously, a slightly smaller
\(cos(ta)\) indicated that simulated dispersers moved with marginally lower
directionality (\(\mu = 0.057\), \(\sigma = 0.071\)) compared to observed
dispersers (\(\mu = 0.078\), \(\sigma = 0.072\)). These differences in step
lengths and turning angles can be attributed to minor disparities between
habitat conditions at the area within which we collected training data and
habitat conditions within the entire study area.

Out of the 50'000 dispersers initiated in protected areas, only 4.5\% eventually
hit a map boundary, highlighting that boundary effects should be neglectable. In
contrast, 78\% of the 30'000 dispersers originating from the buffer zone hit a
map boundary at least once.

\subsection{Heatmaps}
\Cref{Heatmap} depicts the heatmap rendering the traversal frequency at each
pixel of the study area across all simulated individuals and steps. The map
illustrates that large portions of land beyond the borders of the KAZA-TFCA are
only infrequently visited by dispersers (dark blue areas). On the contrary, we
observe that within the KAZA-TFCA extensive regions are regularly visited by
dispersers (bright yellow and red areas). Most notably, the region in northern
Botswana south of the Linyanti swamp glows in rich red and stands out as highly
frequented dispersal hub. Nevertheless, massive water bodies such as the
Okavango Delta, the Makgadikgadi Pan, and the Linyanti swamp, pose considerable
dispersal barriers within and therefore limit realized connectivity the
KAZA-TFCA.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_Heatmap.png}
  \caption{}
  \label{Heatmap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Network Analysis I}
The results of our first network analyses are presented in \Cref{Betweenness}.
In contrast to the heatmap, \Cref{Betweenness} puts much more emphasis on
discrete dispersal corridors. Nonetheless, the dispersal hub in northern
Botswana stands out again and is traversed by a corridor that receives a
comparably high betweenness score. This implies that the region is particularly
crucial for connecting other pixels in the study system and hence represents a
proper dispersal hub. Towards east, the corridor runs through the Chobe National
Park into the Hwange national park, where it branches out and further extends
into the distant Matusadona National Park in Zimbabwe. Northwest of the Linyanty
ecosystem, the same corridor expands into Angola, where it splits and finally
traverses over a long stretch of unprotected area into the Kafue National Park
in Zambia. Several additional corridors with slightly lower betweenness scores
exist, yet most of them run within the boundaries of the KAZA-TFCA. In general,
only few corridors appear to directly link the peripheral regions of the
KAZA-TFCA. For instance, there are no viable dispesal corridors between the
Matusadona National Park in Zimbabwe and the Kafue National Park in Zimbabwe.
Similarly, there are no direct links between the Zimbabwean and Angolan
``spikes'' of the KAZA-TFCA.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_Betweenness.png}
  \caption{Betweenness scores of each raster cell in a raster with 5 x 5 km
  resolution. Betweenness scores were determined based on simulated dispersal
  events. A high betweenness score highlights cells that are exceptionally
  relevant in connecting different regions in the study area. That is, the
  higher the betweenness score, the more often a pixel lies on a shortest path
  between adjacent areas. In this sense the metric can be used to pinpoint
  discrete movement corridors. Note that we square-rooted betweenness scores to
  improve visibility of corrdiors with low scores.}
  \label{Betweenness}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Network Analysis II}
The results from the second network analysis that was focused on connectivity
between national parks are given in \Cref{AreasReached}. The map shows between
which national parks direct links exist and how frequent they are, as well as
the average duration a disperser had to move to realize those links. For
instance, 6.8 \% of the simulated dispersers originating from the Moremi
National Park successfully reached the Chobe National Park and 4.2 \% reached
the Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. On average, dispersers moved for 623 steps
before arriving at Chobe (SD = 520) and for 1'413 steps before arriving at
Hwange (SD = 371).

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_AreasReached.png}
  \caption{Network on simulated dispersal trajectories highlighting the
  connections between national parks (dark green). Yellow bubbles represent the
  center of the different national parks and are sized in relation to the number

  national parks illustrate between which national parks the simulated
  dispersers successfully moved and the color of each arrow shows the average
  number of steps that were necessary to realize those connections.
  Additionally, the line thickness indicates the relative number of dispersers
  originating from a national park that realized those connections.}
  \label{AreasReached}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
Our connectivity network further suggests that dispersers from the Okavango
Delta more likely disperse towards east than west. Indeed, only x out of our y
observed dispersers ever reached the western part of the delta. Only when the
flood retracts a small pathway between the city of Maun and the floodwaters of
the delta emerges and enables dispersers to move towards the detal's western
part.

All of our findings are well in line with our previous work, where we have
highlighted dispersal corridors for wild dogs using least-cost approaches. This
suggests that qualitative results are quite insensitive to the exact
methodological approach. Still, we believe that a simulation based approach
offers possibilities for much richer inferences compared to traditional
approaches. This is largely due to the fact that proper movement trajectories
are generated that can be analysed \textit{as if} they were generated by real
dispersers. This is of course contingent on the assumption that underlying
models are adequately representing movement behavior of the focal species and
calls for further methods to validate the predictive power of such simulations.

While the segment running into Kafue receives a high betweenness score, it was
actually only rarely traversed by our simulated dispersers, as can be seen from
the dark colors in this region in \Cref{Heatmap}. It is therefore worth noting
that the betweenness metric highlights crucial bottlenecks that are relevant for
connecting remote regions, yet does not directly yield information about the
absolute frequency at which these bottlenecks are used.

We have previously attributed the weak significance of distance to water to the
fact that we did not control for the presence or absence of conspecifics. We
stick to this reasoning as our expanded model still shows a rather large
uncertainty around the respective beta coefficients. To better gauge the
imporance and influence of this covariate, future studies will need to control
for inter- and intra-speficic interactions that may explain why and when
dispersers are attracted to or afraid of waterbodies.

For our simulations, we represented the Okavango Delta statically and assumed a
relatively extended flood. This resulted in a quasi-barrier, formed by the
Okavango-Delta and the adjacent city of Maun, which was rarely traversed by
simulated individuals. Out of the 499 dispersers initiated inside the Moremi
National Park, only 101 managed to reach the south-western section of the Delta,
whereas 284 eventually reached the equally distant Linyanti swamp. In this
regard, the heatmap presented in \Cref{Heatmap} may be most representative of
the period shortly after the wet-season, when floodlevels in the Delta are at
their maximum. During the dry season, however, the flood considerably retracts
and potentially clears the way for wild dogs dispersing from the Moremi-Game
reserve into the south-western section of the Delta. Future studies could relax
the assumption of a static flood and attempt to update floodlevels as the
dispersers move. This would allow studying how connectivity within the ecosystem
evolves over time as the flood climaxes and retracts again. In fact, one of the
major advantages of such simulation based approaches is that a dynamic
environment can be rendered, as time is explicit in these models
\citep{Zeller.2020}. This contrasts with traditional modelling approaches such
least-cost analysis or circuit theory, where the temporal dimension cannot be
made explicit. An explicit view on time also directly translates in insights on
the duration required by dispersers to move between distinct patches such as
national parks or spatially segregated subpopulations.

Comparable simulations that are based on empirical data are also a fundamental
component for spatially realistic population models in which dispersal is
rendered more realistically and does not merely depend on the distance between
habitat patches.

We did not model mortality during dispersal in our simulations. This was a
simplifying assumption and only inaccurately reflects dispersal in reality. It
is well known that wild dogs often die during dispersal in result of deadly
encounters with other predators, but also due to road kills and illegal
shootings by humans. In result, mortality during dispersal may limit realized
connectivity, especially in areas that wild dogs are unfamiliar with or in areas
with high potential for human-wildlife conflict \citep{Cozzi.2020}.
Interestingly though, \cite{Behr.2021} have recently demonstrated that mortality
during dispersal is lower compared to residency, suggesting the presence some
fitness benefits to dispering individuals.

In this regard, our approach is rather similar to dispersal kernels, yet it
enables to render directional biases, which are currently difficult to implement
using such methods.

We completely randomized the location of source points within protected areas.
However, in some cases prior knowledge about the density of potential dispersers
is available and can be used to adjust the number of simulated individuals
accordingly. Alternatively, instead of tweaking the number of simulated
individuals, one could assign a weight to each trajectory that depends on the
density of potential dispersers in the source areas. As such, trajectories from
areas with high density would enter the heatmap with above average weigth.

The parametrized movement model could also be manipulated to investigate how
different habitat preferences influence landscape connectivity and to test the
sensitivity of results with respect to the exact preferences of individuals.

One of the major benefits of individual-based simulations is the ability to make
the temporal dimension of movement explicit. This allows to investigate how
connectivity depends on the dispersal duration, something that is not possible
with traditional least-cost or circuit theory methods.

Optimally, one should simulate additional dispersers until the amount of newly
gained information lies beyond a certain threshold, i.e. until some sort of
convergence is achieved. However, due to the myriad of outcomes in movement
behavior, this would often imply countless repetitions for each source points at
each location where dispersal is possibly initiated. This is computationally
infeasible.

Our work suggests that the selection of source points significantly impacts
resulting connectivity networks. Especially when dispersal durations are short,
wrongly placed source points lead to vastly different results. Signer et al.
used estimated utilisation distributions by means of simulated movements. They
used a rather long burn in period prior to alleviate the problem of selecting
meaningful source points. However, this approach only works when individuals
move around a point of attraciton. This is typically not the case when
simulating dispersers, introducing an important trade-off. The researcher can
decide to increase the number of simulated steps, hence reducing the influence
of starting locations, yet this also inevitably increases estimated
connectivity.

In some European countries, the comeback of large predators, such as bears,
lynx, and the wolf, has triggered emotional discussions and raised public
concern \citep{Behr.2017}, particularly in areas with free-roaming livestock
that may be prayed upon by the returned species. In cases were recent locations
of such predators are known, an early warning system based on simulations could
serve to forewarn about potential encounters and and thereby increase public
acceptance of large predators.
