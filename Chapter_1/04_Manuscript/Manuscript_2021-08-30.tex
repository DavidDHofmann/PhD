% Importance of Dispersal & Connectivity
Dispersal of individuals is crucial prerequisite for long-term species
persistence. However, the ability to disperse is contingent on a sufficient
degree of landscape connectivity, which is why the identification of movement
corridors that contribute to connectivity has become a task of extraordinary
importance.

% Quantifying connectivity
Over the past two decades, ecologists have investigated connectivity using
graph-based methods, such as least-cost analysis and circuit theory.
Unfortunately, these methods make several assumptions that are rarely met in
reality. Least-cost analysis, for instance, assumes that animals move towards a
preconceived endpoint and choose a cost-minimizing route accordingly. Circuit
theory, in contrast, presumes a random walk without any directional persistence.
To overcome these unrealistic assumptions, dispersal simulations from
individual-based movement models have been proposed and applied, yet a unified
framework to simulate dispersal and assess connectivity is lacking.

% What we do
Here, we combine several already-existing methods to synthesize a simple
three-step workflow for simulating dispersal and assessing connectivity. In step
one, integrated step selection functions are used to parametrize a mechanistic
movement model. In step two, the parametrized model is applied as an
individual-based movement model to simulate dispersal trajectories. In step
three, simulated trajectories are consolidated into three complementary
connectivity maps, each focusing on a different aspect of connectivity. The set
of maps includes a heatmap, revealing frequently traversed areas, a
betweenness-map, delineating dispersal corridors and bottlenecks, and a map of
inter-patch connectivity, depicting the presence or absence of functional links
between habitat patches.

% Case study
We exemplify the application of the proposed workflow to assess landscape
connectivity for dispersing African wild dogs (\textit{Lycaon pictus}) in the
Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, the world's largest
transboundary conservation area. We thereby demonstrate that simulations from
integrated step selection functions offer a simple but powerful alternative to
traditional connectivity modeling techniques, although necessitating informed
decisions about the number of simulated individuals and the duration of
simulated dispersal events. After all, the proposed workflow enables to relax
several unrealistic assumptions inherent to graph-based methods and permits a
more mechanistic understanding of landscape connectivity.

\section{Introduction}

% Importance of Dispersal & Connectivity
\subsection{Importance of Connectivity \& Connectivity Models}
Dispersal of individuals is a vital process that allows species to maintain
genetic diversity \citep{Perrin.1999, Perrin.2000, Frankham.2002, Leigh.2012,
Baguette.2013}, rescue non-viable populations \citep{Brown.1977}, and colonize
or recolonize unoccupied habitats \citep{Hanski.1999b, MacArthur.2001}. However,
the ability to disperse is contingent on a sufficient degree of landscape
connectivity \citep{Fahrig.2003, Clobert.2012}, which is why the identification
and protection of dispersal corridors that promote connectivity has become a
task of fundamental importance \citep{Nathan.2008, Doerr.2011, Rudnick.2012}.
The identification of dispersal corridors not only necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the factors that limit dispersal, but also an appropriate model
to estimate connectivity \citep{Baguette.2013, Vasudev.2015, Hofmann.2021}. To
date, the two most prominent connectivity models in the literature are
least-cost path analysis (LCPA; \citealp{Adriaensen.2003}) and circuit theory
(CT; \citealp{McRae.2006, McRae.2008}), both graph-based approaches that
quantify conductance of the landscape based on habitat permeability
\citep{Zeller.2012}.

% Issues with Both Methods
\subsection{Issues with Traditional Connectivity Models}
Despite their intuitive nature and ease of use, both methods make rigorous
assumptions that are hardly ever met in reality \citep{Diniz.2019}. With LCPA,
for instance, a least-costly route always exists, even if associated movement
costs are unreasonably high and will never be incurred by dispersing individuals
\citep{Sawyer.2011}. The method also presumes that animals move towards a
preconceived endpoint and choose a cost-minimizing route accordingly
\citep{Abrahms.2017}. While these assumptions may be fulfilled by migrating
animals, they are unlikely to hold for dispersers, as dispersers typically move
across unfamiliar territory and are therefore less aware of associated movement
costs \citep{Koen.2014, Cozzi.2020}. CT relaxes these assumptions, but posits
that animals move according to a random walk, entailing that autocorrelation
between subsequent movements cannot be rendered \citep{Diniz.2019}. In reality,
however, autocorrelation in animal movements is regularly observed
\citep{Bovet.1991, Schultz.2001}, especially during dispersal \citep{Cozzi.2020,
Hofmann.2021}. Some of these deficiencies can be alleviated using less stringent
graph-based methods, such as least-cost \textit{corridors} \citep{Pinto.2009},
\textit{thresholded} least-cost paths \citep{Landguth.2012}, or
\textit{randomized} least-cost paths \citep{Panzacchi.2016}, yet a certain
degree of arbitrariness remains. Besides this, graph-based methods are incapable
of rendering the temporal dimension of dispersal, meaning that statements about
the approximate duration required to move between habitats are impossible
\citep{Martensen.2017, Diniz.2019}.

% What about IBMMs?
\subsection{What about IBMMs?}
To overcome the unrealistic assumptions of LCPA and CT, dispersal simulations
from individual-based movement models (IBMMs) have been proposed and applied
\citep{Diniz.2019}. In these models, dispersal trajectories are simulated based
on movement rules that govern how individuals move across and interact with the
prevailing landscape (e.g. \citealp{Gustafson.1996, Gardner.2004, Graf.2007,
KramerSchadt.2004, Revilla.2004, Revilla.2008, Kanagaraj.2013, Clark.2015,
Allen.2016, Hauenstein.2019, Zeller.2020, Vasudev.2021}). Once the trajectories
are simulated, they are further processed and converted into measures of
connectivity \citep{Kanagaraj.2013, Zeller.2020}. Because IBMMs do not enforce
connections towards preconceived endpoints, simulated individuals are allowed to
dynamically adjust their behavior as they disperse. This enables to render
potential interactions between movement behavior and habitat conditions,
shifting the focus from a structural to a more functional view on connectivity
\citep{Tischendorf.2000, Kanagaraj.2013, Hauenstein.2019}. Furthermore, IBMMs
render movement sequentially, meaning that the temporal dimension of dispersal
becomes explicit and that autocorrelation between movements can be incorporated
\citep{Diniz.2019}. In spite of these advantages, a unified framework to
simulate dispersal and assess connectivity using IBMMs is lacking.

% Proposed Solution: Three-Step Workflow
\subsection{Proposed Solution: Three-Step Workflow}
In this paper, we draw on recent innovations in the field of movement ecology
and network theory to propose a simple three-step workflow for the simulation of
dispersal and assessment of connectivity (\Cref{GraphicalAbstract}). In the
first step, GPS data of the focal species is combined with relevant habitat
covariates and analyzed in an integrated step selection framework to fit a
movement model. In the second step, the parametrized model is employed as an
IBMM to simulate dispersal trajectories across the study area. Finally, in the
third step, simulated trajectories are converted into a set of three
complementary connectivity maps, each focusing on a different aspect of
connectivity. The set of maps includes a heatmap, revealing frequently traversed
areas, a betweenness-map, delineating dispersal corridors and bottlenecks, and a
map of inter-patch connectivity, depicting the presence or absence, intensity,
and dispersal duration of functional links between habitat patches.

% Some Background on SSFs
\subsection{Some Background on SSFs}
To fit a movement model, we propose to employ the framework of step selection
functions (SSFs; \citealp{Fortin.2005, Thurfjell.2014, Avgar.2016}). Originally,
SSFs were developed to learn about habitat preferences of the focal species
using GPS data \citep{Fortin.2005}. The method works by comparing covariates
along realized steps (the straight-line connecting two consecutive GPS
relocations; \citealp{Turchin.1998}) to the same covariates along randomly
generated alternative steps \citep{Fortin.2005, Thurfjell.2014} using
conditional logistic regression \citep{Fortin.2005, Muff.2020}. Recently,
\cite{Avgar.2016} have introduced \textit{integrated} SSFs (ISSFs), which is a
generalization of regular SSFs and requires that movement metrics are included
in the corresponding regression model. This not only reduces biases in estimated
preferences, but also permits simultaneous inference on a species' habitat
kernel (i.e. habitat preferences), its movement kernel (i.e. movement
preferences/capabilities), and potential interactions between the two kernels
\citep{Avgar.2016, Fieberg.2020}. Importantly, a model that was fitted using
ISSFs resembles a fully mechanistic IBMM, based on which movement can be
simulated \citep{Avgar.2016, Signer.2017}. Previously, ISSFs have been applied
to simulate utilization distributions of resident animals \citep{Avgar.2016,
Signer.2017}, yet the method remains underutilized for the simulation of
dispersal and detection of movement corridors.

% Some Background on Connectivity "Metrics"
\subsection{Some Background on  Connectivity ``Metrics'' }
Irrespective of the chosen modeling framework, simulated dispersal trajectories
need to be processed into measures of connectivity. To date, the most common
practice to translate simulations into connectivity measures is to compute
inter-patch connectivity between distinct habitats \citep{Diniz.2019}.
Inter-patch connectivity is a simple ratio between the number of dispersers
successfully moving between habitat patches and the total number of simulated
individuals from each patch (e.g. \citealp{Kanagaraj.2013}). As an alternative,
some researchers have tallied overlapping trajectories into what might be called
``heatmaps'', i.e. maps that depict the frequency at which each spatial unit in
the study area was traversed by simulated dispersers (e.g. \citealp{Peer.2008,
Hauenstein.2019, Zeller.2020}). More recently, \cite{BastilleRousseau.2018}
proposed a method to convert trajectories into a network, so that metrics from
network theory can be computed. With regards to connectivity, the betweenness
metric seems promising, as it indicates the number of shortest paths going
through each node in the network and therefore highlights areas of exceptional
importance for connecting different regions in the study area. Because each of
the three metrics metrics focuses on a very different aspect of landscape
connectivity, we propose to view them as complementary and to use them in
concert when assessing connectivity.

    in this article. First, GPS data and habitat covariates have to be
    collected. The combined data is then analyzed in an integrated step
    selection model, which enables the parametrization of the focal species'
    habitat and movement kernels and results in a mechanistic movement model.
    The parametrized model is then treated as an individual-based movement model
    and used to simulate dispersal trajectories. Ultimately, simulated
    trajectories serve to produce a set of maps that are pertinent to landscape
    connectivity. This includes a heatmap, indicating the traversal frequency
    across each spatial unit of the study area, a betweenness map, highlighting
    movement corridors and bottlenecks, and, finally, an inter-patch
    connectivity map, where the frequency of connections and their average
    duration can be depicted.}

% Case Study
\subsection{Case Study}
To exemplify the application of the proposed workflow in
(\Cref{GraphicalAbstract}), we investigate landscape connectivity for the
endangered African wild dog (\textit{Lycon pictus}) as a case study. While once
present across entire sub-Saharan Africa, this species has disappeared from a
vast majority of its historic range, mainly due to persecution by humans,
habitat fragmentation and destruction, and deadly diseases
\citep{Woodroffe.2012}. Some of the biggest remaining populations reside near
the Moremi Game Reserve in northern Botswana \citep{McNutt.1996, Cozzi.2013,
Behr.2020}, which is part of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area
(KAZA-TFCA), the world's largest transboundary protected area. We previously
assessed landscape connectivity for dispersing African wild dogs within this
ecosystem using least-cost methods \citep{Hofmann.2021}. More specifically, we
used ISSFs to fit a habitat selection model and predicted a permeability surface
based on which we computed least-cost paths and corridors between protected
areas. We now expand on this knowledge and use ISSFs to develop a more detailed,
mechanistic movement model of dispersing wild dogs (\Cref{GraphicalAbstract}).
We then employ the model to simulate 80'000 dispersers moving 2'000 steps across
the landscape of the KAZA-TFCA. Finally, we condense the simulated trajectories
into a heatmap, betweenness-map, and inter-patch connectivity map. We thereby
demonstrate that simulations from ISSFs provide a viable alternative to LCPA or
CT and deliver a more comprehensive understanding of the emergence of
connectivity. Nevertheless, we recognize that simulations from ISSFs entail
several non-trivial modeling-decisions, such as the number of simulated
dispersers and the duration of simulated dispersal events.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Study Area}
The study area of our wild dog case study was defined by a bounding box centered
at -17\degree 13'9''S, 23\degree 56'4''E (\Cref{StudyArea}a) and stretched over
1.3 Mio. km\textsuperscript{2}, encompassing the entire KAZA-TFCA
(\Cref{StudyArea}b). The KAZA-TFCA comprises parts of Angola, Botswana, Namibia,
Zimbabwe, and Zambia and hosts diverse landscapes, ranging from savannah to
grassland and from dry to moist woodland habitats. In its center lies the
Okavango Delta, a dominant hydrogeographical feature and the world's largest
flood-pulsing inland delta. Although large portions of the KAZA-TFCA are
designated national parks and other protected areas, considerable human
influence remains from roads, agricultural sites and settlements.

\end{figure}

\subsection{GPS Data}
GPS data of 16 dispersing wild dogs was obtained as described in
\cite{Cozzi.2020} and \cite{Hofmann.2021}. We collected data on 7 female and 9
male dispersers between 2011 and 2019 from a free-ranging population inhabiting
the Moremi National Park in northern Botswana. Because behavior during dispersal
is more pertinent to landscape connectivity than behavior during residence
\citep{Elliot.2014, Abrahms.2017}, we discarded all data that was collected
during residency. For some individuals, exact dispersal dates were known from
field observations, whereas in other cases, we determined dispersal phases using
net-squared displacement. Net-squared displacement is a metric that measures the
squared Euclidean distance of a GPS relocation to a reference point
\citep{Borger.2012}, which in our case was set to the center of each
individual's natal home range. Thus, dispersal was deemed to have started when
an individual left its natal home range and ended once individuals became
sedentary again. During dispersal, GPS collars recorded a fix every 4 hours and
they regularly transmitted data over the Iridium satellite system. After
collection, we converted GPS coordinates of dispersers (n = 4'169) to steps,
where each step represented the straight-line connecting two consecutive GPS
relocations \citep{Turchin.1998}. To ensure a regular sampling interval, we
removed fixes that were not successfully collected on the 4-hourly schedule (\(
\pm \) 15 minutes) and identified bursts of regularly sampled GPS fixes.

\subsection{Covariates}
We represented the physical landscape in our study area using a set of habitat
covariates, including water-cover, distance-to-water, woodland-cover, and
shrub/grassland-cover. Because water-cover greatly changes within and between
years in the Okavango Delta, we applied a remote sensing algorithm and obtained
weekly updated water-cover layers and corresponding distance-to-water layers
from MODIS satellite imagery (see \citealp{Wolski.2017} and Appendix A3 in
\citealp{Hofmann.2021}). Resulting layers thus temporally aligned with each
dispersal event, ensuring minimal temporal lag between observed movements and
corresponding water layers. We furthermore included a proxy for human influence,
rendering anthropogenic pressures stemming from human-density, agricultural
sites, and roads. All spatial layers were coarsened or interpolated to a target
resolution of 250 m by 250 m. A detailed description of the preparation of each
habitat covariate is provided in \cite{Hofmann.2021}.

Besides habitat covariates, we computed movement metrics that we used as
movement covariates in our ISSF models \citep{Avgar.2016, Fieberg.2020}.
Movement metrics were calculated for each step and included the step length
(\textsf{sl}), its natural logarithm (\textsf{log(sl)}), and the cosine of the
relative turning angle (\textsf{cos(ta)}). Because wild dogs follow a distinct
activity pattern \citep{Castello.2018}, we also coded a binary variable
(\textsf{LowActivity}) indicating whether a step was realized during periods of
low wild dog activity (09:00 to 17:00 local time) or high wild dog activity
(17:00 to 09:00 local time). Handling and manipulation of all data, as well as
all models and simulations were implemented with the statistical software {\tt
R}, version 3.6.6 \citep{R.2020}. Some helper functions were written in {\tt
C++} and imported into {\tt R} using the {\tt Rcpp} package
\citep{Eddelbuettel.2011, Eddelbuettel.2013}.

\subsection{Movement Model}
We used ISSFs to parametrize a mechanistic movement model for dispersing wild
dogs \citep{Avgar.2016}. To conduct ISSF analysis, we paired each realized step
with 24 random steps, so that a realized step plus its 24 random steps formed a
stratum that received a unique identifier. As suggested by \cite{Avgar.2016}, we
generated random steps by sampling random turning angles from a von Mises
distribution with concentration parameter \(\kappa = 0\) (i.e. a uniform
distribution on (\(-\pi, +\pi\))) and step lengths from a gamma distribution
that was fitted to realized steps (scale \(\theta\) = 6'308 and shape \(k\) =
0.37)). Along each step, we extracted and averaged values from the habitat
covariate layers using the {\tt velox} package \citep{Hunziker.2021}. We also
calculated the movement metrics \textsf{sl}, \textsf{log(sl)}, and
\textsf{cos(ta)} for each realized and random step. To facilitate model
convergence, we standardized all continuous covariates to a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one. Since correlation among covariates was low (\(|r| <
0.6\); \citealp{Latham.2011}), we retained all of them for modeling.

To contrast realized steps (scored 1) and random steps (scored 0), we assumed
that animals assigned a selection score \(w(x)\) of the exponential form to each
step \citep{Fortin.2005}. The selection score \(w(x)\) of each step thus
depended on the step's associated covariates (\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)) and on the
animal's preferences (i.e. relative selection strengths; \citealp{Avgar.2017})
towards these covariates (\(\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n\)):

\begin{equation}
\label{EQ1}
  w(x) = exp(\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n)
\end{equation}

The probability of a step being realized was then contingent on the step's
selection score, as well as on the selection scores of all other step in the
same stratum:

\begin{equation}
\label{EQ2}
  P(Y_{i} = 1 | Y_{1} + Y_{2} + ... + Y_{i} = 1) =
  \frac{w(x_{i})}{w(x_{1}) + w(x_{2}) + ... + w(x_{i})}
\end{equation}

\noindent To estimate preferences (i.e. the \(\beta\)'s), we used mixed effects
conditional logistic regression analysis \citep{Muff.2020} that we implemented
using the r-package {\tt glmmTMB} \citep{Brooks.2017}. We treated animal IDs as
random effects and modeled random slopes for each covariate.

The structure of the movement model was based on a habitat selection model that
we previously developed \citep{Hofmann.2021}. In the original model (hereafter
referred to as \textit{base model}), no interactions between habitat covariates
(i.e. \textsf{Water, DistanceToWater\textsuperscript{0.5}, Woodland,
Shrubs/Grassland, Human Influence}) and movement covariates (i.e. \textsf{sl,
log(sl), cos(ta)}) were considered. Hence, we slightly expanded the base model
and proposed interactions between all movement covariates and habitat
covariates, assuming that movement behavior depends on habitat conditions. More
specifically, we started with the base model and incrementally increased model
complexity by adding all possible two-way interactions between habitat
covariates and movement covariates. For instance, for the covariate
\textsf{Water}, we proposed the interactions \textsf{Water:sl},
\textsf{Water:log(sl)}, and \textsf{Water:cos(ta)}. Besides these interactions,
we also allowed for correlations between turning angles and step lengths by
proposing the interactions \textsf{sl:cos(ta)} and \textsf{log(sl):cos(ta)}.
Furthermore, we formed the interactions \textsf{sl:LowActivity} and
\textsf{log(sl):LowActivity} to render that step lengths are likely to be
shorter during periods of inactivity. To assess the most parsimonious movement
model among model candidates, we ran stepwise forward model selection based on
Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC, \citealp{Burnham.2002}).

We validated the predictive power of the most parsimonious movement model using
k-fold cross-validation for case-control studies \cite{Fortin.2009}.
Specifically, we randomly assigned 80\% of the strata to a training set and the
remaining 20\% to a testing set. With the training data we parametrized a
movement model and predicted selection scores \(w(x)\) for all steps in the test
data. Within each stratum, we then assigned ranks 1-25 to each step based on
predicted selection scores, so that rank 1 was given to the step with the
highest score \(w(x)\). Within each strata, we determined the realized step's
rank and calculated rank frequencies of realized steps across all strata.
Finally, we computed Spearman's rank correlation between ranks and associated
frequencies \(r_{s, realized}\). We replicated this procedure 100 times and
computed the mean correlation coefficient (\(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\)), as well
as its 95\% confidence interval across all replicates. For comparison, we
repeated the same procedure 100 times assuming random preferences. Random
preferences were implemented by discarding the realized step from all strata and
identifying the rank of a random step in each stratum. Again, we calculated
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\(r_{s, random}\)), its mean across
repetitions (\(\bar{r}_{s, random}\)), and its 95\% confidence interval.
Ultimately, this validation proves a significant prediction in case the
confidence intervals of \(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\) and \(\bar{r}_{s, random}\) do
not overlap \citep{Fortin.2009}.

\subsection{Dispersal Simulation}
We used the most parsimonious movement model to simulate 80'000 virtual
dispersers moving across the KAZA-TFCA. The simulation resembled an
``inverted''  ISSF and was set up as follows. (1) We defined a random source
point and assumed a random initial orientation of the animal. (2) Departing from
the source point, we generated 25 random steps by sampling turning angles from a
uniform distribution (\(-\pi, +\pi\)) and step lengths from our fitted gamma
distribution. Similar to the input data, each random step represented the
straight line movement possible within 4 hours. To prevent unreasonably large
steps, we restricted sampled step lengths to a maximum of 35 km, which
corresponded to the farthest distance ever traveled within 4 hours by one of our
dispersers. (3) Along each random step, we extracted and averaged values from
the habitat covariate layers and we calculated movement covariates. To ensure
compatible scales with the fitted movement model, we standardized extracted
values using the same scaling parameters that we applied to standardize our
input data. (4) We applied the parametrized movement model to predict the
selection score \(w(x)\) for each step and we translated predicted scores into
probabilities using \ref{EQ2}. (5) We sampled one of the random steps based on
predicted probabilities and determined the animal's new position. We then
repeated steps (2) to (5) until 2'000 steps were realized.

To mitigate edge effects and to deal with random steps leaving the study area,
we followed \cite{Koen.2010} and artificially expanded all covariate layers by
a 100 km wide buffer zone. Within the buffer zone, we randomized covariate
values by resampling values from the original covariate layers. Through this
buffer zone, simulated dispersers were able to leave and re-enter the main study
area. In cases where proposed random steps transgressed the outer border of this
buffer zone, we resampled transgressing steps until they fully lied within the
buffer zone, forcing individuals to be repelled from these map borders.

\subsection{Source Points}
We released 80'000 virtual dispersers from 80'000 unique source points
distributed across the study area. 50'000 virtual dispersers were released from
randomly selected source points within contiguous protected areas that were
large enough to sustain viable wild dog populations (\(>\) 700
km\textsuperscript{2}; \citealp{Pomilia.2015}), whereas another 30'000
dispersers were released at random locations inside the 100 km wide buffer to
render potential immigrants into the study system. By distributing source points
randomly, the number of source points per km\textsuperscript{2} was
approximately equal.

\subsection{Convergence}
\textcolor{red}{Maybe this paragraph should go into another paper?} To verify
that the number of simulated individuals sufficed to ensure reliable estimates
of connectivity, we evaluated how the relative traversal frequency across the
landscape changed as we increased the number of simulated individuals. For this,
we distributed 1'000 rectangular ``checkpoints'', each with an extent of 5 km x
5 km at random locations inside the main study area (excluding the buffer). At
each checkpoint, we then determined the relative traversal frequency by
simulated dispersers as we increased the number of simulated individuals from 1
to 50'000. To assess variability in the relative traversal frequency, we
repeatedly subsampled 100 times from all 50'000 and computed the mean traversal
frequency across replicates, as well as its 95\% confidence-interval. We deemed
that a checkpoint converged as soon the width of the confidence-interval dropped
below a value of 0.01.

\subsection{Heatmap}
To identify dispersal hotspots across our study area, we created a heatmap
indicating the absolute frequency at which each raster-cell in our study area
was visited by virtual dispersers (e.g. \citealp{Peer.2008, Hauenstein.2019,
Zeller.2020}). For this, we rasterized all simulated trajectories and tallied
them into a single map. If the same trajectory crossed a raster-cell twice, we
only counted it once, thereby mitigating biases from individuals that were
trapped and moved in circles. To achieve high performance rasterization, we used
the R-package {\tt terra} \citep{Hijmans.2021b}.

\subsection{Betweenness}
To pinpoint discrete movement corridors and bottlenecks, we converted simulated
trajectories into a network and calculated betweenness scores for each
raster-cell in the study area \citep{BastilleRousseau.2018}. Betweenness
measures how often a specific network-node (i.e. raster-cell) lies on a shortest
path between any other pair of nodes and is therefore pertinent to connectivity
\citep{BastilleRousseau.2018}. To transform simulated trajectories into a
network, we overlaid the study area (including the buffer) with a raster
resolved at 5 km x 5 km, where the center of each raster-cell served as node in
the final network. To identify edges (connections) between the nodes, we used
the simulated trajectories and determined all transitions occurring from one
node to another, as well as the frequency at which those transitions occurred.
This resulted in an edge-list that we translated into a weighted network using
the r-package {\tt igraph} \citep{Gabor.2006}. The weight of each edge was
determined by the frequency of transitions, yet because {\tt igraph} handles
edge weights (\(\omega\)) as costs, we inverted the traversal frequency in each
cell by applying \(\omega = \frac{mean(Traversal Frequency)}{Traversal
Frequency_i}\). Consequently, edges that were traversed frequently were assigned
small weights and vice versa. Finally, we used the weighted network to calculate
betweenness scores for all network nodes.

\subsection{Inter-Patch Connectivity}
To examine functional links between distinct patches in the KAZA-TFCA, we
calculated inter-patch connectivity between national parks. The decision to
focus on national parks was purely out of simplicity and does not imply that
connections between other protected areas are impossible. To quantify
inter-patch connectivity, we computed the relative frequency at which dispersers
originating from one national park successfully moved into another national
park. Successful movement was said to be achieved if the individuals' trajectory
intersected with the corresponding national park at least once. We also recorded
the number of steps required until the first intersection with the respective
national park, allowing us to compute average dispersal durations from one park
to another. In summary, we determined \textit{if} and \textit{how often}
dispersers moved between certain national parks, as well as \textit{how long}
dispersers had to move to realize those connections.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Movement Model}
Our most parsimonious movement model resulting from the ISSF analysis consisted
of a movement kernel, a habitat kernel, and their interactions. Compared to the
base model reported in \citep{Hofmann.2021}, the movement model retained several
additional interactions between habitat covariates and movement covariates
(\Cref{MovementModel} and \Cref{MovementModelNumbers}). Although multiple models
received an AIC weight above zero (Table 1 in Appendix S1), we only considered
results from the most parsimonious model for simplicity. Since all models with
positive AIC weight contained similar covariates (Table S1), this decision only
marginally influenced subsequent steps. To aid with the interpretation of the
final model, we followed \cite{Fieberg.2020} and produced a collection of
auxiliary plots that are provided in Appendix S2.

When all other covariates held constant at their means, the habitat kernel
reveals that dispersing wild dogs avoid water but prefer its proximity, that
dispersers avoid areas that are covered by woodlands, yet prefer regions covered
by shrublands or grasslands, and that dispersers avoid movement through
landscapes that are dominated by humans. All of these effects are strong and
significant, except for the effect of \textsf{distance to water}, which is
insignificant on the 5\% significance level.

With regards to the movement kernel, the positive estimate for \textsf{cos(ta)}
indicates that dispersers move with directional persistence, unlike what was
proposed by the uniform turning angle distribution. This preference is
particularly pronounced when dispersers realize large steps (i.e. move quickly),
as indicated by the positive estimates for \textsf{cos(ta):sl} and
\textsf{cos(ta):log(sl)}. Finally, the negative estimate for the interaction
\textsf{sl:LowActivity} reveals that wild dogs realize shorter steps (i.e. move
slower) between 09:00 and 17:00 o'clock than during the rest of the day. Aside
from the interaction \textsf{sl:LowActivity}, which has a very strong effect,
effects are moderate strength yet significant on the 5\% significance level;
only the interaction \textsf{cos(ta):sl} appears as insignificant on the 5\%
significance level.

Finally, several significant interactions between movement and habitat
covariates suggest that movement behavior is contingent on habitat conditions.
For example, there's strong evidence that dispersers realize shorter steps in
areas covered by water or in forested areas. Furthermore, it appears that
dispersers realize larger steps in areas that are dominated by shrubs/grassland,
but shorter steps in areas that are distant to water. Finally, it seems that the
preference for directional persistence is less pronounced when dispersers cross
human-dominated landscapes, yet more pronounced at great distance from water.
Nevertheless, some of these effects are only weakly significant and exhibit
small effect sizes.

The k-fold cross-validation of the movement model shows that the model
substantially outperforms a random guess (\Cref{MovementModel}b) and correctly
assigns high selection scores to realized steps. Confidence intervals of
\(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\) and \(\bar{r}_{s, random}\) do not overlap and
therefore prove a reliable prediction. Furthermore, the significant correlation
between ranks and corresponding frequencies for realized steps indicates a good
fit between predictions and observations (\Cref{MovementModel}b). In comparison
to the base model (\(\bar{r}_{s, realized} = -0.55\); \citealp{Hofmann.2021}),
the inclusion of interactions between movement and habitat covariates slightly
improved model performance (\(\bar{r}_{s, realized} = -0.65\).

\subsection{Dispersal Simulation}
On a machine with an octa-core AMD Ryzen 7 2700X processor (8 x 3.6 GHz, 16
logical cores) and 64 GB of RAM, a batch of 1'000 simulated dispersers moving
over 2'000 steps required 90 minutes to compute (\(\mu = 88.90\), \(\sigma =
1.87\)). Consequently, the simulation of all 80'000 dispersers (160 Mio. steps)
terminated after 120 hours (i.e. five days). Comparable simulations will be
substantially faster for smaller study areas and lower resolution covariates, as
the covariate extraction from large and high-resolution rasters was
computationally the most demanding task. Out of the 50'000 dispersers initiated
inside the main source area, only 4.5\% were eventually repelled by a map
boundary, suggesting that biases due to boundary effects should be minimal.

\subsection{Convergence}
Our examination of the traversal frequencies across checkpoints shows that we
reached convergence across all checkpoints after 10'500 simulated individuals
(\Cref{Convergence}a and b). Even though variability kept decreasing as we
increased the number of simulated individuals, the marginal benefit of each
additional disperser diminished quickly (\Cref{Convergence}c).

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_Convergence}
    \caption{Relative traversal frequency through 1'000 checkpoints (5 km x 5
    km) distributed randomly across the study area. The relative traversal

    simulated dispersers.}
    \label{Convergence}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Heatmap}
\Cref{Heatmap} depicts the heatmap from all simulated individuals after 2'000
steps (additional maps in Appendix SX). The map shows that large portions of
land beyond the borders of the KAZA-TFCA are only infrequently visited by
dispersers (dark blue areas), whereas within the KAZA-TFCA several extensive
regions are regularly traversed (bright yellow and red areas). Most notably, the
region in northern Botswana south of the Linyanti swamp stands out as a highly
frequented dispersal hotspot. Still, the presence of several massive water
bodies, such as the Okavango Delta, the Makgadikgadi Pan, and the Linyanti
swamp, restricts dispersal movements and limits realized connectivity within the
KAZA-TFCA. Similarly, the heatmap shows that dispersal across Zambia's and
Zimbabwe's part of the KAZA-TFCA is limited, which can largely be attributed to
substantial human influences resulting from high human density, roads, and
agricultural activities in these areas. Outside the KAZA-TFCA, the most heavily
used regions include the areas inside the Central Kalahari National Park in
Botswana, the area south-west of the Khaudum National Park in Namibia, and the
area around the Liuwa Plains National Park in Zambia. Even though the heatmap
facilitates the identification of areas that are intensely used by virtual
dispersers, it is not straightforward to spot dispersal corridors.
Consequently, we turn to the betweenness map.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_Heatmap.png}
  \caption{Heatmap showing traversal frequencies of 80'000 simulated dispersers
  moving 2'000 steps across the KAZA-TFCA. Simulations were based on an
  integrated step selection model that we fitted to the movement data of
  dispersing African wild dogs. To generate the heatmap, we rasterized and
  tallied all simulated trajectories. Consequently, the map highlights areas
  that are frequently traversed by virtual dispersers. Additional heatmaps
  showing the traversal frequency when individuals move fewer than 2'000 steps
  are provided in Appendix S3. For spatial reference we plotted a few selected
  national parks (dark gray).}
  \label{Heatmap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Betweenness}
Betweenness scores emerging after 2'000 simulated steps are presented in
\Cref{Betweenness} and reveal a set of discrete dispersal corridors (additional
maps in Appendix SX). Again, the region in northern Botswana stands out as a
central dispersal hub that connects more remote regions in the study system.
Towards east, the extension of this corridor runs through the Chobe National
Park into the Hwange National Park. From there, a further extension connects to
the distant Matusadona National Park in Zimbabwe. Northwest of the Linyanty
ecosystem, a major corridor expands into Angola, where it splits and finally
traverses over a long stretch of unprotected area into the Kafue National Park
in Zambia. Several additional corridors with slightly lower betweenness scores
exist, yet most of them run within the boundaries of the KAZA-TFCA. In general,
only a few corridors directly link the peripheral regions of the KAZA-TFCA. For
instance, there are few corridors between the Matusadona National Park in
Zimbabwe and the Kafue National Park in Zimbabwe. Similarly, there are no direct
links between the Zimbabwean and Angolan ``spikes'' of the KAZA-TFCA. In
comparison to the heatmap, the betweenness map facilitates the identification of
linear corridors and bottlenecks between habitat patches.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_Betweenness.png}
  \caption{Map of betweenness scores, highlighting distinct dispersal corridors
  and potential bottlenecks across the extent of the KAZA-TFCA. A high
  betweenness score indicates that the respective area is exceptionally
  important for connecting different regions in the study area. In this sense
  the metric can be used to pinpoint discrete movement corridors
  \citep{BastilleRousseau.2018}. Note that we square-rooted betweenness scores
  to improve visibility of corridors with low scores.}
  \label{Betweenness}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Inter-Patch Connectivity}
Results from the analysis of inter-patch connectivity are given in
\Cref{AreasReached}, which shows all realized links by simulated dispersers
between national parks. The map furthermore indicates the relative frequency at
which dispersers originating from one national park successfully reached another
national park, as well as the average duration dispersers had to move to realize
those links. It is again worth pointing out that the figure is only intended as
an illustration, as for clarity we only considered inter-patch connectivity
between national parks (NPs), albeit plenty of links between other protected
areas exist. Overall, inter-patch connectivity between NPs in Angola, Namibia,
and Botswana appears to be high, with relatively short dispersal durations
between national parks. In contrast, we observe that connections from the
central region into the Kafue NP in Zambia require rather long dispersal events
and are rather infrequent. Similarly, relatively few connections lead into
Zimbabwe's Chizarira and Matusadona NP. In some cases, we also find imbalances
between ingoing and outgoing links, hinting at potential source-sink dynamics
that occur due to asymmetries in disperser's willingness to cross an area,
depending on the direction in which the area is traversed. For instance, while a
fair share of dispersers originating from the Chizaria NP in Zimbabwe manages to
move into the Hwange NP, there are comparably few dispersers that succeed in the
opposite direction.

% The map shows all realized links by simulated dispersers between national parks
% and indicates the average duration a disperser had to move to realize those
% links. For instance, 6.8 \% of the simulated dispersers originating from the
% Moremi National Park successfully reached the Chobe National Park and 4.2 \% the
% Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. On average, dispersers moved for 623 steps
% before arriving at Chobe (SD = 520) and for 1'413 steps before arriving at
% Hwange (SD = 371). While the map only depicts connections between national
% parks, this does not imply that no connections to other protected areas exist
% and is the result of our simplifying assumptions above. Interestingly, while we
% identified a potential dispersal corridor between Angola's NPs and the Kafue NP
% in Zambia, \Cref{AreasReached} suggests that this link is only rarely realized
% and requires very long dispersal events. In contrast, we find that dispersal
% between the Moremi NP and Chobe NP are relatively frequent and require fewer
% steps, which can be expected given that the areas are located close to each
% other.

\section{Discussion}

% Short Summary
\subsection{Short Summary}
We used ISSFs to analyse data of dispersing wild dogs and to parametrize a fully
mechanistic movement model describing how dispersers move through the available
landscape. We employed the parametrized model as an individual-based movement
model to simulate 80'000 dispersing wild dogs moving 2'000 steps across the
extent of the KAZA-TFCA, the world's largest transboundary conservation area.
Based on simulated dispersal trajectories, we derived three complementary maps,
each geared towards a better understanding of dispersal and landscape
connectivity. The set of maps included a heatmap, revealing frequently traversed
areas, a betweenness-map, delineating critical dispersal corridors, and a map of
inter-patch connectivity, indicating the presence or absence of functional links
between national parks as well as the average dispersal duration required to
realize those links. We thereby showcase that ISSFs offer a simple, yet powerful
framework to parametrize movement models and simulate dispersal to assess
landscape connectivity. Importantly, individual-based simulations from ISSFs
overcome several conceptual shortcomings inherent to more traditional
connectivity modeling techniques, such as LCPA and CT.

% Movement Model
\subsection{Movement Model}
Because our movement model of dispersing wild dogs comprised two interacting
kernels, it effectively rendered habitat and movement preferences of dispersers,
as well as how preferences depended on habitat conditions. Results from the
habitat kernel were largely in concert with previous studies that investigated
habitat selection by dispersing wild dogs \citep{DaviesMostert.2012,
Masenga.2016, Woodroffe.2019, Oneill.2020, Hofmann.2021}. However, by also
incorporating a movement kernel, we were able to model several additional
complexities inherent to dispersal. For instance, we could accommodate that
dispersers move with directional persistence \citep{Cozzi.2018, Hofmann.2021}
and exhibit step lengths that are correlated with turning angles
\citep{Morales.2004, Borger.2012} by including the appropriate interactions in
the movement model. While correlations between step lengths and turning angles
could also be rendered by sampling them from copula probability distributions
\citep{Hodel.2021a}, the ISSF framework allowed us to directly incorporate them
in the movement model. In addition, by forming interactions between habitat
covariates and movement covariates, we could render potential dependencies
between movement and habitat preferences. For example, our final model contained
an interaction between water-cover and step length, showing that dispersers
realize shorter steps in areas covered by water. Likewise, we found that
dispersers move more tortuously across water bodies than over dryland, which is
clearly to be expected, given that wild dogs have to wade or swim when
traversing waterbodies. The ability of accompanying such effects in a single
model is one of the great strengths of ISSFs \citep{Avgar.2016, Fieberg.2020},
which is why we believe the method offers a suitable framework for simulating
movement and assessing connectivity.

\subsection{Simulation}
Our simulation of 80'000 dispersers moving 2'000 steps across the landscapes of
the KAZA-TFCA required five days of computation on a modern desktop machine. The
long simulation time was primarily caused by the massive extent considered (ca.
1.8 Mio. km\textsuperscript{2} when including the buffer) and the large number
of dispersers simulated. Most connectivity studies are limited to much smaller
extents (e.g. \citealp{Kanagaraj.2013, Clark.2015, McClure.2016, Abrahms.2017,
Zeller.2020}) and will therefore achieve faster simulation times. We also
believe that fewer simulated dispersers will often suffice, as the relative
traversal frequency by simulated individuals through randomly placed checkpoints
in the study area converged already after 10'500 simulated individuals. However,
the required number of simulated individuals to achieve reliable estimates of
connectivity will vary depending on the structure of the landscape and the
dispersal ability of the focal species.

\subsection{Maps}
The heatmap generated from simulated dispersal trajectories highlighted that
numerous individuals traversed the Moremi NP and the Chobe NP in northern
Botswana. We previously uncovered the same area as potential dispersal hotspot
using least-cost methods \citep{Hofmann.2021}, yet it has been questioned
whether this was a consequence of the region being located in the center of the
study area and connections being enforced between predefined start and
endpoints. With the current simulations, connections were no longer enforced and
simulated individuals were able to leave the main study area. Nonetheless, a
majority of simulated individuals traversed the area in northern Botswana. This
suggests that the dispersal hotspot is not merely an artifact of the applied
method but truly results from landscape characteristics. The same region is also
pronounced on the betweenness map, implying that it facilitates the relocation
of individuals into more remote regions of the KAZA-TFCA. While this is an
example of an area where both the heatmap and the betweenness map attest great
importance, there are other instances where this is not true. For example, while
the area between the Lengue-Luiana NP in Angola and the Kafue NP in Zambia
receives a high betweenness-score, the heatmap shows that the area is only
rarely traversed by dispersers. Hence, despite the region's importance for
linking Angola's NPs to Zambia's NP, only few simulated dispersers actually used
the corridor. Conversely, we find that the Central Kalahari NP receives a low
betweenness score, despite being highly frequented by simulated dispersers.
Besides highlighting frequently traversed areas and dispersal corridors, we also
also consulted inter-patch connectivity between NPs, depicting the presence or
absence of functional links between national parks. Because dispersal movements
were rendered sequentially, we could also derive the average dispersal duration
that was required to realize those links. This enabled us to show that movements
from Angola into Zambia's Kafue NP are rare and require a large number of steps
, whereas dispersal between the Moremi NP and Chobe NP occurs frequently and
requires relatively few steps. All in all, the rich inference that can be drawn
from the ensemble of proposed connectivity maps.

% Other studies that use similar simulations
\subsection{Related Literature}
Our approach of simulating movement to assess connectivity is related to a
series of previously published papers. \cite{Clark.2015}, for instance,
collected GPS data on American black bears (\textit{Ursus americanus}) and used
SSFs to fit a habitat selection model. They then used the fitted model to
simulate movement and identify likely movement corridors between four distinct
habitat patches. For the same species, \cite{Zeller.2020} used SSFs and
forecasted seasonal habitat connectivity under changing land-use. Because both
of these studies relied on \textit{regular} SSFs, rather than
\textit{integrated} SSFs, they could not account for interdependencies among
habitat and movement preferences \citep{Avgar.2016}. In addition, both studies
employed data collected on resident individuals instead of dispersers, although
evidence suggests that residents are more reluctant to cross areas that are
readily traversed by dispersers \citep{Elliot.2014, Gaston.2016, Abrahms.2017,
Keeley.2017}. The application of data collected on resident animals may
therefore result in an underestimate of connectivity \citep{Elliot.2014}. Two
further studies that used SSFs to simulate animal movement have been conducted
by \cite{Potts.2013} and \cite{Signer.2017}, yet the primary purpose here was to
estimate steady-state utilization distributions of resident animals and not on
the analysis of dispersal and connectivity.

\subsection{Advantages of ISSF Simulations}
% Does not enforce route towards known endpoint
A simulation-based approach as proposed in this article offers several
advantages over LCPA and CT. In contrast to LCPA, for instance, an
individual-based simulation does not require to assume known endpoints. Instead,
each endpoint emerges naturally from a simulated dispersal trajectory. The
ability of not needing to provide endpoints is particularly valuable for
dispersal studies, because dispersers often venture into unfamiliar territory
and are therefore unlikely to know the destination of their journey
\citep{Elliot.2014, Abrahms.2017, Cozzi.2020}. Moreover, LCPA always enforces a
connection towards the pre-defined endpoints, even if associated movement costs
are unreasonably high. With simulations from ISSFs this is no longer the case. A
connectivity model that does not require pre-defined endpoints also ensures that
movement corridors are not enforced between certain start- and endpoints, which
permits to detect potential routes that do not lead into suitable habitats but
into ecological traps \citep{Dwernychuk.1972, VanDerMeer.2014} or areas with a
high susceptibility for human wildlife conflicts \citep{Cushman.2018}.

% Explicit Representation of Time
In contrast to LCPA and CT, simulations from ISSFs furthermore yield the
advantage of an explicit representation of time, which enables to answer
questions such as: ``\textit{How long will it take a disperser to move from A to
B?}'' or ``\textit{Is it possible for a disperser to move from A to B within X
days?}''. An explicit representation of time also yields opportunities
for studying how seasonality affects connectivity and to investigate whether
some dispersal corridors are only available temporarily (\textit{dynamic
connectivity}; \citealp{Zeller.2020}). With LCPA or CT, incorporating
seasonality is currently impractical, as both methods require a static
permeability surface as inputs. Hence, the only possibility to study seasonality
effects is to repeat the same analysis using different permeability surfaces,
each rendering the environment at a different point in time (e.g.
\citealp{Benz.2016, Osipova.2019}). With simulations from ISSFs, on the other
hand, the environment can be rendered dynamically ``as the dispersers move'',
such that simulated individuals can respond to seasonal factors directly within
the simulation. Hence, rather than employing a set of static habitat layers,
each layer would be updated as the dispersers move, thus correctly rendering
seasonal changes in the environment.

% Requires Detailed Knowledge on Step Lengths and Turning Angles
While an explicit representation of time provides several benefits, it requires
that step lengths and turning angles are modeled properly
\citep{Kanagaraj.2013}, so that dispersal durations between areas can be
estimated reliably. Correctly rendering step lengths and turning angles under
varying environmental conditions is one of the key strengths of ISSFs
\citep{Avgar.2016, Prokopenko.2017, Fieberg.2020}, which is why we believe that
the framework is exceptionally well suited for simulating dispersal and
assessing landscape connectivity. In addition, the framework enables to model
autocorrelation between step lengths and turning angles, thereby incorporating
directional persistence. Here, we only considered first order autocorrelation,
i.e. correlation between two consecutive steps. Although higher order
autocorrelation is conceivable and might be desirable to model, this requires
vast amounts of GPS data that is not intercepted by missing fixes and is
therefore often impractical to model in reality.

\subsection{Disadvantages of ISSF Simulations}
Despite the benefits that simulations from ISSFs offer, we also want to confer
some of the non-trivial modeling decisions involved.

In particular, it is worth pointing out five modeling decisions: (1) number of
simulated individuals, (2) location of source points, (3) dispersal duration,
(4) boundary behavior, and (5) how to handle uncertainty and individual
variability.

(1) When simulating dispersal, the modeler needs to decide on the number of
simulated individuals. A higher number is always desirable, as each additional
disperser provides novel information about landscape connectivity. However, this
comes at the cost of computational efficiency, implying that a trade-off needs
to be managed. As noted by \cite{Signer.2017}, the trade-off can be handled by
simulating additional individuals only until estimated metrics converge. Here,
we employed the relative traversal frequency across checkpoints as target metric
and found that convergence across all checkpoints was already achieved after
10'500 simulated individuals, yet we recognize that this strongly depends on the
focal species dispersal ability and landscape characteristics.

(2) Aside from specifying the absolute number of simulated individuals, one also
needs to define a source point within a suitable source area for each
individual. Here, we placed source points within protected areas large enough to
sustain viable wild dog populations. Given that wild dogs primarily survive in
formally protected areas \citep{Woodroffe.1999, DaviesMostert.2012,
Woodroffe.2012, VanDerMeer.2014} we considered this decision to be appropriate.
Due to a lack of precise knowledge about wild dog abundances in the different
protected areas, we distributed source points randomly within them. If, however,
corresponding data is available, source points can be distributed accordingly,
reflecting the fact that source areas do not necessarily produce an identical
number of dispersers. Alternatively, source points can be distributed
homogeneously, but be weighted afterwards according to estimated densities in
the respective source area. In cases where knowledge about suitable source areas
is lacking, these could also be delineated using habitat suitability models
(e.g. \citealp{Squires.2013}). After all, the challenge of selecting meaningful
source areas and source points is not unique to individual-based simulations and
also applies to LCPA or CT.

(3) When employing ISSFs to simulate dispersers, it is also required to decide
on meaningful dispersal durations (i.e. number of simulated steps). When
sufficient dispersal data of the focal species is available, dispersal durations
can be sampled from observed dispersal events. Due to the low number of observed
dispersal events and due to the great variability in wild dogs' dispersal
distances \citep{DaviesMostert.2012, Masenga.2016, Cozzi.2020} we opted against
this approach. Instead, we simulated individuals for 2'000 steps, which is at
the upper end of observed dispersal durations. Once the trajectories have been
simulated, it is straightforward to subsample them and investigate the
sensitivity of derived results with regards to different dispersal durations.

(4) Unless simulated individuals are strongly drawn towards a point of
attraction (e.g. \cite{Signer.2017}), dispersers eventually approach a map
boundary, so that one or several of the proposed random steps leave the study
area. In theoretical applications, this issue can be circumvented by simulating
movement on a torus \citep{Hodel.2021b}. For real data, however, alternative
solutions are needed. One approach would be to terminate the simulation,
assuming that the simulated animal left the study area forever. This can be
problematic for individuals that are initiated in areas that are located close
to map boundaries, especially since already a single random step leaving the
study area breaks the simulation. Here, instead of breaking the simulation loop,
we simply resampled transgressing random steps until they fully lied within the
study area. This enforced simulated dispersers to be repelled by map boundaries
and to remain within the main study area. Additionally, we artificially
increased the study area using a buffer zone with randomized covariate values.
This enabled virtual dispersers to leave and re-enter the main study area. The
same method has been shown to effectively mitigate edge effects for graph-based
connectivity models \citep{Koen.2010}.

(5) We simulated dispersal using point estimates from our most parsimonious
movement model. Depending on the amount of data and individual variability,
these estimates can be subject to substantial uncertainty. For dispersal studies
in particular, the low amount of data typically results in model coefficients
with large confidence intervals \citep{Wiegand.2003, KramerSchadt.2007}. In
these cases, point estimates may lead to biased connectivity estimates, which is
why we urge future studies to investigate the sensitivity of ISSF simulations
with respect to employed model parameters and to simulate dispersal based on
parameters that encapsulate model uncertainty.

\subsection{Conclusion}
To this end, we proposed and applied a simple three-step workflow that uses
ISSFs to parametrize an individual-based movement model from which dispersal can
be simulated with the purpose of informing about landscape connectivity. By
explicitly simulating dispersal trajectories, simulations enable a more
mechanistic understanding of connectivity, and overcome several of the
unrealistic assumptions inherent to graph-based connectivity models, such as
leas-cost analysis or circuit theory. We exemplified the application of the
proposed workflow using data of dispersing wild dogs to assess landscape
connectivity for the species within the KAZA-TFCA ecosystem. With this, we hope
to have sparked interest in the powerful framework of step selection functions
for investigating dispersal behavior and landscape connectivity. Nevertheless,
we propose to view simulations from ISSF-models as complementary and not as
substitutes to traditional connectivity modeling techniques.

% % Some step length, turning angle comparisons
% On average, step lengths realized by the simulated dispersers (\(\mu_{sl} =
% 2'093\) m, \(\sigma_{sl} = 3'067\)) were slightly shorter than those by observed
% dispersers (\(\mu_{sl} = 2'326\) m, \(\sigma_{sl} = 3'323\)) and simulated
% dispersers moved marginally less directional (\(\mu_{cos(ta)} = 0.057\),
% \(\sigma_{cos(ta)} = 0.071\)) compared to observed dispersers (\(\mu_{cos(ta)} =
% 0.078\), \(\sigma_{cos(ta)} = 0.072\)). These differences in step lengths and
% turning angles can be attributed to minor disparities between habitat conditions
% at the area within which we collected training data and habitat conditions
% within the entire study area.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%  Further Topics to Discuss
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% % Simulations for an early warning system?
% Finally, simulations from ISSFs could be utilized as forecasting tool to predict
% the likely whereabouts of GPS collared animals into the near future. In some
% European countries, the reintroduction of large predators, such as bears, lynx,
% and wolves, has triggered emotional discussions and raised public concern
% \citep{Behr.2017}, particularly in areas where locals depend on income from
% free-roaming livestock. An early warning system based on simulations could thus
% serve to inform about potential encounters with large carnivores, such that
% farmers can secure their livestock accordingly. This would hopefully increase
% public acceptance of large predators.

% % Downsides of connectivity?
% Even though connectivity is in general thought to promote population viability,
% it is also related to various aspects that may cause ecological damage, such as
% increased connectivity into human-dominated areas or facilitated spread of
% deadly diseases \citep{Brearly.2013}. Nevertheless, information on the
% relationship between connectivity and the prevalence of deadly diseases in
% African wild dogs is currently lacking.

% % Social landscape
% We have previously attributed the weak significance of distance to water to the
% fact that we did not control for the presence or absence of conspecifics. We
% stick to this reasoning as our expanded model still shows a rather large
% uncertainty around the respective beta coefficients. To better gauge the
% importance and influence of this covariate, future studies will need to control
% for inter- and intra-specific interactions that may explain why and when
% dispersers are attracted to or afraid of waterbodies. \cite{Fortin.2005}, for
% instance, found that elk movement was significantly impacted by the density of
% wolf in the area, such that habitat preferences strictly differed depending on
% the presence or absence of wolves. The decision to settle is likely related to
% the presence or absence of conspecifics. Hence, the exact dispersal duration and
% distance will not be independent of current wild dog densities. In dispersing
% wolves, for instance, the longest dispersal distances have been observed in
% low-density populations \citep{Boyd.2005, Wabakken.2007}. The dispersal duration
% may thus be determined by the by the amount of isolation between subpopulations
% and population densities \citep{DaviesMostert.2012}

% % Can generate multiple metrics
% Another benefit of simulations from ISSFs is that their output can be processed
% using a diverse suite of approaches, each enabling to focus on a different
% aspect of connectivity. the results from LCPA and CT, on the other hand, are
% usually restricted to single ``conductance'' maps. By turning simulated
% trajectories into a network, for instance, researchers can capitalize on
% concepts from network theory and calculate network metrics that are pertinent to
% landscape connectivity \citep{BastilleRousseau.2018}. Here, we exemplified
% this by calculating the betweenness metric, highlighting major movement
% corridors. Alternatively, can learn about inter-patch connectivity and potential
% source-sink dynamics between patches \citep{Ferreras.2001, Revilla.2004,
% Kanagaraj.2013} based on simulated dispersal trajectories. Ultimately, by
% accounting for habitat- and movement preferences of the focal species,
% simulations from ISSFs are capable of rendering the behavioral ecology of the
% focal species in detail, thereby permitting a more functional view on
% connectivity that is not solely driven by the landscape structure and distances
% between patches \citep{Gustafson.1996, Gardner.2004, Graf.2007,
% KramerSchadt.2004, Revilla.2004, Revilla.2008, Kanagaraj.2013}.

% % We did not validate all of our predictions
% Even though our simulations generated several interesting results, most of them
% need to be validated using independent data. We learned that between some
% national parks asymmetries between the number of ingoing and outgoing dispersers
% exist, suggesting that some patches act as sinks, whereas others serve as
% sources for dispersers.

% % Modeling Mortality
% Although we did not render mortality, animals regularly die during dispersal,
% mainly due to deadly encounters with predators, road kills, and persecution by
% humans \citep{Bonnet.1999, Woodroffe.2012, Behr.2021b}. Mortality during
% dispersal could therefore substantially limit functional connectivity
% \citep{Bowler.2009}, especially in areas where the likelihood of encountering
% competitors and humans is high \citep{Cozzi.2020}. If corresponding information
% is available, mortality can and should be included in ISSF simulations.

% % Spatially Realistic Population Models
% The ability to realistically render movement during dispersal not only serves to
% investigate landscape connectivity, but also forms the foundation for more
% realistic spatially explicit population models in which dispersal is not merely
% rendered through dispersal kernels or cellular automata movements
% \citep{Visintin.2020}, but mechanistically based on observed movement and
% habitat preferences (e.g. \citealp{Revilla.2008}, \citealp{Kleinmann.2017}).
% Such models can ultimately be employed to conduct population viability analyses
% \citep{Boyce.1992} in which species' dispersal abilities are taken into account.

% % Modeling Decisions
% \begin{figure}
%   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{99_ModelingDecisions.png}
%   \caption{Five major modeling decisions that a researcher needs to consider
%   when simulating dispersers to assess landscape connectivity. (1) Number of
%   simulated trajectories. (2) Handling individual variation: we used point
%   estimates when simulating dispersers, assuming that there was no individual
%   variation. Alternatively, however, one could draw preferences for each
%   simulated individually based on model uncertainty. (3) Dispersal duration.
%   While one could draw the number of simulated steps based on observed dispersal
%   events, we opted for an alternative and simulated each individual for 2'000
%   steps, which was at the upper end of observed dispersal durations. This allows
%   to easily shorten the generated trajectories afterwards and to investigate the
%   sensitivity of results with regards to the dispersal duration. (4) Boundary
%   behavior. We allowed dispersers to leave and re-enter the main study area
%   through a buffer zone with randomized covariate values. Alternatively, one
%   could discard transgressing random steps, thereby forcing dispersers to remain
%   within the study area or simply terminate the simulation, assuming the

%   points should optimally be biologically informed. For our simulation, we
%   placed source points within protected areas large enough to sustain viable

%   according to a habitat suitability model or based on abundance information.

%   study area.}
