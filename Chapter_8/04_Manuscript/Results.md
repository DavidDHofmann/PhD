Figures for each of the four derived metrics are provided in figure xx,
difference plots highlighting the absolute diffeence in each metric between the
two scenarios are given in xx. As can been from fig a. Addiitonal, source
specific maps for each metric can be found in the appendix.

# Heatmaps
- During minimum flood, large areas that are otherwise covered by the flood are
  frequently traversed by dispersing individuals
- Especially the region between source areas 1 and 2
- During maximum flood, when the floodwaters almost reach Maun, only few
  individuals are able to traverse the area
- Creates a barrier between source area 1 and 6
- Line of separation during full flood splitting 1 and 5 from 2 3 4
- creating a clear separation between the western part of the delta (areas 1
  and 5), and the eastern part of the delta (areas 2, 3, 4)
- Particularly evident when looking at source specific heatmaps (Appendix)
- View visible differences beyond the close vicinity of the delta
- Interestingly, when the flood is high, the dispersers are more "evenly" distributed across space
To test for autocorrelation:
- Moran's I (not great as it relates to a single distance)
- Correlogram (extension of Moran, cant do because the data is too much)
- Variogram (a bit more useful)
- Refer to the difference map too
- heatmap clearly shows that floodwaters of the OD, but also of the Linyanti
  Swamp push away dispersers
- Little influence across the remainder of the study area

# Betweenness
Mirrored by the betweenness maps, were several dispersal pinchpointsl ead
across the delta during minimal flood but are pushed further away during
maximum flood. This results in a single, almost straight line corridor
stretching from 1 to 2. In comparison to a minimum flood, this forces
individuals to move closer towards the village of Maun. Several corridors
leading into area six, yet these are redirected during maximum flood.

# HWC
Depending on the flood, two clusters with elevated potential for human wildlife
conflict emerge. The first cluster lies at the inflow of the Okavango Delta
between source areas 4 and 5 and is most pronounced during minimum flood.
Another, albeit visually less evident, cluster covers the area at the distal
end of the OD, stretching from lake Ngami to Maun. This area is more pronounced
at maximum flood.

# IPC
Patterns of interpatch connectivity clearly demonstrate substantial reductions
in the frequency, and increases in the duration of dispersal between
neighboring source areas. (some numbers). How many emigrated?
Overall, emigration from the OD's vicinity slightly increased from xx to xx.


# Discussion
While the expansion of the flood leads to a clear reduction in connectivity for
some areas, we also observe increases in connectivity towards other regions.
This is mainly caused by individuals utilizing different routes depending on
flood levels. For example, individuals originating from source area 1 will
readily move towards source area 2 during minimum flood, yet get repelled
during maximum flood. They then either remain close to their origin or instead
move in a westerly direction. As such, the extreme flooding can be thought of
as a driver that shifts connectivit y into other areas of the landscape.

# Ideas
One could distribute many more circular areas (or hexagons) and run simulations
from those (or create them afterwards and simulate individuals randomly). Then,
one could apply network analysis to identify compartements / modules / groups
of connected areas. -> A network view reveals connectivity compartements for
dispersing african wild dogs in different seasons. May be able to get this from
the network for the betweenness maps as well. At least, use the same script
when you do it with hexagons.

Sum up the toal (squared) differences of min-max maps for each of the source areas

Can map the differences to the different concessions. Doesn't look very exciting though
