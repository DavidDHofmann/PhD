# Dispersal through Physical, Seasonal, and Extreme Landscapes (PhD Thesis)
This repository contains all R-scripts and ($\LaTeX$) files from David D.
Hofmann's PhD thesis, entitled *Dispersal through Physical, Seasonal, and
Extreme Landscapes*. The associated data is either hosted on dedicated
repositories (e.g., dryad) or can be shared upon reasonable request. The
repository contains the following chapters.

- `Chapter_1`: *A Three-Step Approach for Assessing Landscape Connectivity vis
  Simulated Dispersal: African Wild Dog Case Study.*

  In this chapter, I propose a novel way of assessing landscape connectivity
  using dispersal simulations from integrated step-selection functions. The
  associated manuscript was published with Landscape Ecology
  (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-023-01602-4).

- `Chapter_2`: *Dispersal and Connectivity in Increasingly Extreme Climatic
  Conditions.*

  In this chapter, I study how changes in landscape conditions due to climate
  change could affect connectivity for dispersing wild dogs. Specifically, I
  investigate differences in connectivity due to altered flood conditions of
  the Okavango Delta. This chapter was published in Global Change Biology
  (https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17299).

- `Chapter_3`: *The Effects of Increasing Seasonal Dynamism when Predicting
  Connectivity: Advantages or Unnecessary Complications?*

  In this chapter, I examine the importance of correctly accounting for
  seasonality when predicting dispersal and connectivity. I also demonstrate
  how simulations from integrated step-selection functions provide an
  unprecedented ability to account for seasonality when assessing connectivity.
  This chapter is currently in preparation for submission.

- `Chapter_4`: *Methods for Implementing Integrated Step-Selection Functions
  with Incomplete Data.*

  In this chapter, I propose methods that allow dealing with slightly irregular
  data in step-selection functions. Notably, these methods allow retaining data
  that traditionally needed to be discarded to meet the assumption of
  regularity. This chapter was published in Movement Ecology
  (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40462-024-00476-8).

There is a folder for each chapter, each containing two subfolders:

- `02_R-Scripts`: This folder contains R-Scripts used for the analyses. The
  associated data is either deposited in an appropriate repository (Dryad, see
  publications) or can be requested from the main author.

- `04_Manuscript`: This folder contains all documents to compile the $\LaTeX$
  documents, including the main manuscript and supplementary material.

The folder `FinalThesis` brings together the individual chapters and combines
them into a single document. It also includes the general introduction and
discussion.
