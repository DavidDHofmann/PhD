  \caption{Overview of the different dimensions in which seasonality can be
  rendered in studies of landscape connectivity. (a) During model fitting, the
  modeler needs to decide whether to represent the environment by a static set
  of covariate layers, thus ignoring seasonality, or whether to obtain a dynamic
  set covariate layers that allow rendering it. One also needs to decide
  whether to parameterize a single-season model, assuming fixed preferences
  across the year, or to engage in a multi-season model that accounts for
  seasonal differences. (b) When utilizing the fitted model to predict
  connectivity, one can either assume a static set of environmental covariates
  or again attempt a seasonal take that renders how connectivity differs
  depending on the season. (c) Depending on these decisions, six different
  combinations with differing degrees of dynamism emerge. Our hypothesis was
  that increasing the degree of dynamism would lead to improved predictions.
  However, we were particularly interested in determining at which stage the
  inclusion of seasonally provided the biggest benefits.}

  area from which data on dispersing wild dogs were collected. Dispersal
  trajectories are plotted in dark gray. The study area encompassed parts of the
  Okavango Delta in northern Botswana, a highly dynamic, flood-pulse-driven
  ecosystem. The entire study area undergoes substantial seasonal changes, as
  can be seen from two satellite images taken during peak dry season (b1) and
  peak rainy season (b2). Notably, the flood of the Okavango Delta reaches its
  maximum extent during peak dry season (Augustâ€“September).}

  illustration of a dispersal simulation with dynamic covariates. As the
  simulation proceeds, the underlying covariates (symbolized by the stack of
  layers) are updated. In our case, the update frequency of covariate layers
  varied from a few hours (e.g., temperature) to multiple months (e.g., shrub
  cover). Each gray block represents a single layer and the duration for which
  it was ``active''. Originating from the current position of the simulated
  animal, a new redistribution kernel is derived. We generated redistribution
  kernels by proposing a set of random steps and applying the parametrized
  step-selection model to predict the probability of each step for being chosen.
  Based on this kernel, one location was randomly sampled and the animal's
  position updated. This procedure was repeated until the number of simulated
  steps matched the number of steps from the observed individuals.}

  either fit a simple model without interactions or a full model with
  interactions and we distinguished between models fit using static or dynamic
  covariates. Only the underlined covariates differed between the static and
  dynamic configurations, as covariates were either represented as a single
  layer (static), or a stack of layers (dynamic). Furthermore, data was either
  pooled across seasons (yellow bars) or split into dry (green bars) and wet
  (blue bars) season.}

  100 replicates. Note that the y-axis is inverted to match our expectation of
  increasing performance as dynamism increases. (b) Difference in Spearman's
