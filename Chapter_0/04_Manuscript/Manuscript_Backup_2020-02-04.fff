    suggest that our prediction is significant and robust, evidenced by the fact
    that the confidence intervals of \(\bar{r}_{s, realized}\) and \(\bar{r}_{s,

    \caption{(a) Estimated parameters from the social model. Negative
    coefficients indicate avoidance of a covariate, positive coefficients
    selection of a covariate. Whiskers delineate the 95\%-CIs for estimated
    parameters. The intercept is meaningless in the iSSF framework and was thus
    omitted. (b) Corresponding surface plots for two-way interactions (red box).
    Light areas in the surface plots depict preferred combinations of the
    covariates, whereas darker areas correspond to avoided combinations. The
    absolute values along the axes have no meaning as original values were
    normalized to 0 (low) and 1 (high).}
